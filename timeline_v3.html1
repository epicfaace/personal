    <h1>4th BCE: Pannini's description of Sanskrit</h1>
    <p>In India, Pannini creates an exact and complete description of
      the Sanskrit language, including pronunciation. Sanskrit could be
      recreated using nothing but Pannini's grammar.
      Pannini's grammar is
      probably the first formal system of any kind, predating Euclid. Even
      today, nothing like it exists for any other natural language of
      comparable size or corpus. Pannini is the object of serious study
      today. But in the 1940's and 1950's Pannini is almost unknown in
      the West.
      Pannini will have no direct effect on the other events in
      this timeline.

    <h1>1906: Markov's chains</h1>
    <p>Andrey Markov introduces his
      <term>chains</term>
      -- a set of
      states with transitions between them.<footnote>
        <bibref>Markov 1906</bibref>.
      </footnote>
      One offshoot of Markov's work will be what we now
      know as regular expressions.
      Markov uses his chains,
      not for parsing,
      but for addressing a problem in probability --
      does the law of large numbers require that events be
      independent?<footnote>
        Indirectly, Markov's purpose may have been
        to refute Nekrasov's proof of free will.
        Nekrasov pointed out that social statistics of all kinds
        follow the law of large numbers,
        which (up until then)
        had assumed events were independent.
        Since social events were human choices,
        Nekrasov saw this as a proof of free will.
        Markov's demonstration that the law of large
        numbers works just as well for dependent events
        undercut Nekrasov's proof.
        (<bibref>Hayes 2013</bibref>, pp. 92-93).
      </footnote>.
    </p>
    <h1>1913: Markov and Eugene Onegin</h1>
    <p>In 1913, Markov revisits his chains,
      applying them to the sequence of vowels and consonants
      in Pushkin's
      <cite>Eugene Onegin</cite><footnote>
        <bibref>Markov 1913</bibref>.
        See

        and
        <bibref>Hilgers and Langville 2006</bibref>, pp. 155-157.
      </footnote>.
      Again, Markov's interest is not in parsing.
      Nonetheless,
      this is an application of what later will be regarded
      as a parsing technique to language,
      and apparently for the first time in the West.

    <h1>1943: Post's rewriting system</h1>
    <p>Emil Post defines and studies a formal rewriting system<footnote>
        <bibref>Post 1943</bibref>.
      </footnote>
      using productions.
      With this, the process of rediscovering Pannini in the
      West begins.</p>
    <h1>1945: Turing discovers stacks</h1>
    <p>Alan Turing discovers the stack as part of his design of the
      ACE machine. This is important in parsing because recursive parsing
      requires stacks. The importance of Turing's discovery is not noticed
      at the time and stacks will be rediscovered many times over the
      next two decades<footnote>

    <h1>1948: Shannon repurposes Markov's chains</h1>
    <p>Claude Shannon publishes the foundation paper of information theory<footnote>
        <bibref>Shannon 1948</bibref>.
      </footnote>.
      In this
      paper, Shannon models English using Andrey Markov's
      chains<footnote>
        <bibref>Shannon 1948</bibref>, pp. 4-6.
        See also
        <bibref>Hilgers and Langville 2006</bibref>,
        pp. 157-159.
      </footnote>.
      The approach is similar to Markov's but the intent
      seems to be different --
      Shannon's is a serious attempt at a contribution
      to parsing human languages.
    </p>
    <h1>1949: Rutishauser's compiler</h1>
    <p>From 1949 to 1951 at the ETH Zurich, Heinz Rutishauser worked on
      the design of what we would now call a compiler<footnote>
        <bibref>Knuth and Pardo 1976</bibref>,
        pp. 29-35, 40.
      </footnote>.
      Rutishauser's arithmetic expression parser
      did not honor precedence but it does allow nested parentheses.
      It is perhaps the first algorithm which can really be considered a
      parsing method.
      Rutishauser's compiler was never implemented.</p>
    <h1>The Operator Issue as of 1949</h1>
    <p>
      In the form of arithmetic expressions, operator expressions
      are the target of the first efforts at automatic parsing.
      We will not see this issue go away.
      Very informally<footnote>
        The formal apparatus for describing operator expressions is not fully formed
        as of 1949.
      </footnote>,
      we can say that
      an operator expression is an expression
      built up from operands
      and operators.
      It is expected that the operand might be another operator expression,
      so operator expressions raise the issue of recursion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The archetypal examples of operator expressions are arithmetic expressions:
    </p><pre><tt>
         2+(3*4)
         13^2^-5*9/11
         1729-42*8675309
      </tt></pre>
    <p>
      In Western mathematics arithmetic expressions were read
      according to traditional
      ideas of
      associativity and precedence:
    </p><ul>
      <li><tt>^</tt>
        is exponentiation.
        It right associates and has tightest<footnote>
          This timeline refers to precedence levels as
          <q>tight</q>
          or
          <q>loose</q>.
          The traditional terminology is confusing: tighter
          precedences are
          <q>higher</q>
          but traditionally the
          precendence levels are also numbered and the higher
          the number, the lower the precedence.
        </footnote>
        precedence.
      </li>
      <li>
        Multiplication (<tt>*</tt>) and division (<tt>/</tt>) left associate.
        They have a precedence equal to each other
        and less tight than that of exponentiation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Addition ('+') and subtraction ('-') left associate.
        They have a precedence equal to each other
        and less tight than that of multiplication and division.
      </li>
      <li>
        Parentheses, when present, override the traditional
        associativity and precedence.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Certainly in the first attempts at parsing in compilers,
      arithmetic expressions are central.
      The first compiled languages are organized line-by-line and,
      except for arithmetic expressions,
      lines are
      interpreted using basic string manipulations.
      It is only when those string manipulations turn to dealing
      with arithmetic expressions that they become sophisticated
      enough to be called parsing techniques.
      And only then does a parsing theory to describe
      those techniques become helpful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rutishauser's language, and in fact all languages before
      LISP,
      are structured line-by-line.
      No language before ALGOL is truly block-structured.
    </p>
    <p>
      The line-by-line languages
      are parsed using string manipulations.
      A parsing theory is not helpful for describing these
      ad hoc string manipulations,
      so they don't give rise to one.
      The only logic in these early compilers that really deserves to be called
      a parsing method
      is that which tackles arithmetic expressions.
    </p><p>
    </p>
    <h1>1950: Boehm's compiler</h1>
    <p>During 1950, Corrado Boehm, also at the ETH Zurich develops his
      own compiler.
      Rutishauser and Boehm are working at the same institution at the same
      time, but Boehm is unaware of Rutishauser's work until his own is
      complete.
      Boehm's is also the first self-compiling compiler -- it is written
      in its own language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like Rutishauser, Boehm's language is line-by-line and
      parsed ad hoc, except for expressions. Boehm's expression parser
      <em>does</em>
      honor precedence, making it perhaps the first operator precedence
      parser<footnote>
        Many of the
        <q>firsts</q>
        for parsing algorithms in this
        timeline are debatable,
        and the history of operator precedence is especially murky.
        Here I follow
        <bibref>Samuelson and Bauer 1960</bibref>
        in giving the priority to Boehm.
      </footnote>.
      In Norvell's taxonomy<footnote>
        <bibref>Norvell 1999</bibref>.
      </footnote>,
      Boehm's algorithm inaugurates
      the
      <q>classic approach</q>
      to operator parsing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boehm's compiler also allows parentheses, but the two cannot
      be mixed -- an expression can either be parsed using precedence
      or have parentheses, but not both.
      And like Rutishauser's, Boehm's compiler is never
      implemented<footnote>

        pp 35-42.

    <h1>1952: Grace Hopper uses the term
      <term>compiler</term></h1>
    <p>Grace Hopper writes a linker-loader,
      and calls it a
      <term>compiler</term><footnote>
        <bibref>Knuth and Pardo 1976</bibref>, p. 50.
      </footnote>. Hopper seems to be the first
      person to use this term for a computer program.</p>
    <h1>"Compiler" as of 1952</h1>
    <p>Hopper used the term
      <term>compiler</term>
      in a meaning it
      had at the time:
      <q>to compose out of materials from other
        documents</q><footnote>
        The quoted definition is from
        <bibref>Moser 1954</bibref>, p. 15,
        as cited in
        <bibref>Knuth and Pardo 1976</bibref>,
        p. 51.
      </footnote>.
      Specifically, in 1952,
      subroutines were new,
      and automated programming
      (what we would come to call
      <q>compiling</q>)
      often was viewed as providing a interface
      for calling a collection of
      carefully chosen assembler subroutines<footnote>
        In 1952, an interface that guided calls to subroutines
        was much more helpful than current programmers might
        imagine:
        "Existing programs for similar problems were unreadable
        and hence could not be adapted to new uses."
        (<bibref>Backus 1980</bibref>, p. 126)
      </footnote>.
      Hopper's new
      program took this subroutine calling
      one step further -- instead of calling the subroutines
      it expanded them (or in Hopper's terms
      <q>compiled</q>
      them) into
      a single program.
      Since Hopper the term
      <term>compiler</term>
      has acquired a
      more specialized and somewhat different meaning in the computer field.
      Today we would
      not call Hopper's program a
      <term>compiler</term><footnote>
        I hope nobody will read this terminological clarification as in any sense
        detracting from Hopper's achievement.
        Whatever it is called, Hopper's program was a major advance,
        both in terms of insight and execution, and her energetic followup
        did much to move forward the events in this timeline.
        Hopper has a big reputation and it is fully deserved.
      </footnote>.
    </p>
    <p>As we have seen, programs that today we
      <em>would</em>
      call compilers
      were envisioned before Hopper,
      but nobody called these programs compilers -- compiling in our modern sense
      was called
      <q>automatic coding</q>,
      <q>codification automatique</q>
      or
      <q>Rechenplanfertigung</q><footnote>

      it.

      compiler, by which he means that
      it was actually implemented and used by someone to translate
      algebraic statements into machine language.
      Glennie's AUTOCODE
      was very close to the machine -- just above machine language.
      It did not allow operator expressions.
    </p>
    <p>
      AUTOCODE was hard-to-use,
      and apparently saw little use by anybody but
      Glennie himself.
      Because
      Glennie worked for the British atomic weapons projects his papers
      were routinely classified,
      so even the indirect influence of AUTOCODE was
      slow to spread.
      Nonetheless, many other
      <term>compilers</term>
      afterward were named AUTOCODE, which probably indicates
      awareness of Glennie's effort<footnote>

      </footnote>.
      Chomsky demolishes the idea that natural language grammar can be
      modeled using only Markov chains. Instead, the paper advocates a
      natural language approach that uses three layers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Chomsky uses
        Markov's chains
        as his
        <b>bottom layer</b>.
        This becomes the modern compiler's
        <b>lexical phase</b>.</li>
      <li>Chomsky's
        <b>middle layer</b>
        uses context-free
        grammars and context-sensitive grammars.
        These are his own
        discoveries<footnote>
          Chomsky seems
          to have been unaware of Post's work -- he does not cite it.
        </footnote>.
        This middle layer becomes the
        <b>syntactic phase</b>
        of modern
        compilers.</li>
      <li>Chomsky's
        <b>top layer</b>, again his own
        discovery, maps or
        <term>transforms</term>
        the output of the middle
        layer. Chomsky's top layer is the inspiration for
        the AST transformation
        phase of modern compilers.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Term: "Parser"</h1>
    <p>Chomsky is a turning point, so much so that he establishes or settles the
      meaning of many of the terms we are using.
      A
      <term>parser</term>,
      for our purposes, is something or someone that transforms
      a string of symbols into a
      structure,
      according to a description
      of the mapping from strings to structures.
      For our purposes,
      the structures can usually be considered to be parse trees.</p>
    <h1>Term: "Recognizer"</h1>
    <p>In contrast to a parser,
      a
      <term>recognizer</term>
      is a something or someone that
      takes a string and answers
      <q>yes</q>
      or
      <q>no</q>
      --
      <q>yes</q>
      if the string is in the language described by the recognizer,
      <q>no</q>
      otherwise.
      Note that,
      if we intend to do semantics,
      a recognizer alone is not sufficient.
    </p>
    <p>In the strict sense, a recognizer cannot driver a compiler --
      a compiler needs a parser.
      But recognizers can be far easier to write,
      and are often hacked up
      and pressed into service as parsers.
      For example, if your semantics is simple and non-recursive,
      you might be able to drive your semantics phase with
      the output of
      a regex engine, using captures.

      <cite>Syntactic Structures</cite></h1>
    <p>Noam Chomsky publishes
      <cite>Syntactic Structures</cite><footnote>
        <bibref>Chomsky 1957</bibref>.
      </footnote>, one of the most important books of
      all time.
      The orthodoxy in 1957 is structural linguistics which
      argues, with Sherlock Holmes, that
      <q>it is a capital mistake
        to theorize in advance of the facts</q>.
      Structuralists start
      with the utterances in a language, and build upward.</p>
    <p>But Chomsky claims that without a theory there are no facts: there
      is only noise. The Chomskyan approach is to start with a grammar,
      and use the corpus of the language to check its accuracy. Chomsky's
      approach will soon come to dominate linguistics.</p>
    <h1>Term: "Chomskyan parsing"</h1>
    <p>From here on,
      parsing theory
      divides into Chomskyan and
      non-Chomskyan.
      Chomskyan parsing theory becomes and remains the mainstream
      but it is far from unchallenged.
    </p><p>
      Above we defined a
      <term>parser</term>
      (<term>recognizer</term>)
      as something or someone that
      parses (recognizes) a string
      according to a description.
      In Chomskyan parsing (recognizing),
      the description is that of Chomsky's middle layer.
      If the description is anything else,
      the parser (recognizer) is non-Chomskyan.
    </p>
    <p>
      As of 1957, we are calling the description
      of a Chomskyan middle layer,
      a
      <term>context-free grammar</term>
      --
      BNF notation for context-free grammars
      has not yet been discovered.
      Once it is,
      we will refer to context-free grammars
      as BNF grammars.
    </p>
    <h1>1957: FORTRAN released</h1>
    <p>Backus's team makes the first FORTRAN compiler available to IBM
      customers. FORTRAN is the first high-level language that will find
      widespread implementation. As of this writing, it is the oldest
      language that survives in practical use.</p>
    <p>FORTRAN I is a line-by-line language.
      Its parsing is non-Chomskyan.
      But it includes one important discovery.
      FORTRAN allows expressions and,
      learning from the
      dissatisfaction with the IT compiler,
      FORTRAN honors associativity
      and precedence.</p>
    <p>The designers of FORTRAN used a strange trick for parsing operator expresssions --
      they hacked the expressions by adding parentheses around each
      operator.
      The number of parentheses varied, depending on the operator.
      Surprisingly, this works.
      In fact, once the theoretical
      understanding of operator precedence comes about,
      the FORTRAN
      I implementation is recognized
      as a hackish and inefficient way of
      implementing the classic operator precedence algorithm.</p>
    <h1>1958: LISP released</h1>
    <p>John McCarthy's LISP appears. LISP goes beyond the line-by-line
      syntax -- it is recursively structured. But the LISP interpreter does
      not find the recursive structure: the programmer must explicitly
      indicate the structure herself, using parentheses.
      Similarly, LISP does not have operator expressions in the usual sense --
      associativity and precedence must be specified with parentheses.
    </p>
    <h1>1959: Backus's notation</h1>
    <p>Backus discovers a new notation to describe the IAL language<footnote>
        Backus's notation is influenced by his study of Post --
        he seems not to have read Chomsky until later.
        See

      According to Backus's recollection,
      his paper<footnote>
        <bibref>Backus 1959</bibref>.
      </footnote>
      has only one reader: Peter Naur<footnote>
        <bibref>Backus 1980</bibref>, pp. 132-133.
      </footnote>.
      The IAL language will soon be renamed ALGOL.

    <h1>1959: Operator precedence and stacks</h1>
    <p>Samuelson and Bauer<footnote>
        <bibref>Samuelson and Bauer 1960</bibref>.
      </footnote>
      describe the use of stacks to implement
      operator precedence.
      Samuelson and Bauer do not use the word
      <term>stack</term>
      --
      what we call a
      <term>stack</term>,
      they call a
      <term>cellar</term>.
      And they explain the idea in great detail.
      Apparently, 14 years after Turing's discovery of them,
      stacks are still unfamiliar,
      even to the readers of technical journals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their algorithm, and its presentation,
      are thoroughly non-Chomskyan.
      Samuelson and Bauer do not provide
      a context-free grammar for their grammar,
      just an operator precedence table.
    </p>
    <h1>The Operator Issue as of 1959</h1>
    <p>Since Boehm,
      many people have been refining operator precedence.
      With Samuelson and Bauer,
      what Norvell<footnote>
        <bibref>Norvell 1999</bibref>.
      </footnote>
      calls "the classic algorithm"
      takes a well-documented form.
      The Samuelson and Bauer paper was very influential.
    </p>
    <h1>1960: The ALGOL report</h1>
    <p>The ALGOL 60 report<footnote>
        <bibref>ALGOL 1960</bibref>.
      </footnote>
      specifies, for the first time, a block
      structured language. ALGOL 60 is recursively structured but the
      structure is implicit -- newlines are not semantically significant,
      and parentheses indicate syntax only in a few specific cases. The
      ALGOL compiler will have to find the structure.
    </p>
    <h1>The Parsing Problem</h1>
    <p>With the ALGOL 60 report, a quest begins which continues to this day:
      to find a parser that solves the Parsing Problem.
      Ideally such a parser is
    </p>
    <ul id="loc-quest">
      <li>efficient,</li>
      <li>practical,</li>
      <li>declarative, and</li>
      <li>general.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It is a case of 1960's
      optimism at its best. As the ALGOL committee is well aware, a parsing
      algorithm capable of handling ALGOL 60 does not yet exist. But the
      risk they are taking has immediate results --
      1961 will see a number of discoveries that are still important
      today.
      On the other hand, the parser they seek remains elusive for
      decades.

    <p>In the ALGOL 60 report<footnote>
        <bibref>ALGOL 1960</bibref>.

      Peter Naur improves the Backus notation and uses it to describe
      the language.
      This bring Backus' notation to wide attention.
      The improved notation will become known as Backus-Naur Form
      (BNF).

    <h1>Term: "declarative"</h1>
    <p>For our purposes, a parser is
      <term>declarative</term>,
      if it
      will parse directly and automatically from grammars written in BNF.
      Declarative parsers are often called
      <term>syntax-driven</term>
      parsers.
    </p>
    <h1>Term: "procedural"</h1>
    <p>A parser is
      <term>procedural</term>, if it requires procedural
      logic as part of its syntax phase.
    </p>
    <h1>Term: "general"</h1>
    <p>A general parser is a parser that will parse
      any grammar that can be written in BNF<footnote>
        As a pedantic point, a general parser need only parse
        <term>proper</term>
        grammars. A BNF grammar is
        <term>proper</term>
        if it has no useless rules and no infinite loops.
        Neither of these
        have any practical use, so that the restriction to proper grammars
        is unproblematic.

    </p>
    <h1>1960: Gleenie's compiler-compiler</h1>
    <p>The first description of a consciously non-Chomskyan compiler
      seems to predate the first description of a Chomskyan parser.
      It is A.E. Gleenie's 1960 description of his compiler-compiler<footnote>
        <bibref>Glennie 1960</bibref>.
      </footnote>.
      Glennie's
      <term>universal compiler</term>
      apparently is useable,
      but it is more of a methodology
      than an implementation -- the compilers must be written by
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glennie uses BNF,
      but he does
      <em>not</em>
      use it in the way
      Chomsky, Backus and Naur intended.
      Glennie is using BNF to describe a
      <b>procedure</b>.
      In true BNF, the order of the rules does not matter --
      in Glennie's pseudo-BNF order matters very much.
      This means that, for most practical grammars,
      Glennie's pseudo-BNF and BNF proper do
      <b>not</b>
      describe the same language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glennie is well aware of what he his doing, and
      is not attempting to deceive anyone --
      he points out that the distinction
      between his procedural pseudo-BNF and declarative BNF,

    <h1>1961: The first parsing paper</h1>
    <p>In January, Ned Irons publishes a paper describing his ALGOL
      60 parser.
      It is the first paper to fully describe any parser.
      The Irons algorithm is pure Chomskyan
      and top-down with a bottom-up
      <term>left
        corner</term>
      element -- it is what now would be called a
      <term>left
        corner</term>
      parser<footnote>
        <bibref>Irons 1961</bibref>.
        Among those who state that
        <bibref>Irons 1961</bibref>
        parser is what
        is now called
        <term>left-corner</term>
        is Knuth (<bibref>Knuth 1971</bibref>, p. 109).
      </footnote>.
    </p>
    <p>The Irons parser is declarative and general.
      And since it is general,
      operator expressions are within the power of
      the Irons parser<footnote>
        Although it seems likely that parsing operator expressions would require
        backtracking,
        and therefore could be inefficient.
      </footnote>.
    </p>
    <h1>Term: "Top-down"</h1>
    <p>A top-down parser deduces the consituents of a rule from the rule.
      That is, it looks at the rule first,
      and then deduces what is on its RHS.
      Thus, it works from the start rule, and works
      <q>top down</q>
      until it arrives at the input tokens.
    </p>
    <p>It is important to note that no useful parser can be purely top-down --
      if a parser worked purely pure top-down, it would never look at its input.
      So every top-parser we will consider has
      <em>some</em>
      kind of bottom-up element.
      That bottom-up element may be very simple -- for example, one character lookahead.
      The
      <bibref>Irons 1961</bibref>
      parser,
      like most modern top-down parsers,
      has a sophisticated bottom-up element.
    </p>
    <h1>Term: "Bottom-up"</h1>
    <p>A bottom-up parser deduces a rule from its constituents.
      That is, it looks at either the input or at the LHS symbols
      of previously deduced rules,
      and from that deduces a rule.
      Thus, it works from the input tokens, and works
      <q>bottom up</q>
      until it reaches the start rule.
      A parser can be be purely bottom-up,
      but for efficiency it is usually best to eliminate potential
      parses based on the grammar,
      and that requires some kind of top-down logic.
    </p>
    <h1>Term: "Synthetic attribute"</h1>
    <p><bibref>Irons 1961</bibref>
      also introduces synthetic attributes: the parse creates
      a tree, which is evaluated bottom-up. Each node is evaluated using
      attributes
      <q>synthesized</q>
      from its child nodes<footnote>
        Irons is credited with the discovery of synthetic attributes
        by Knuth (<bibref>Knuth 1990</bibref>).
      </footnote>.
      Synthetic attributes are a concept in semantics, not parsing,
      but they will be important for us.
    </p>
    <h1>1961: Lucas discovers recursive descent</h1>
    <p>Peter Lucas publishes his description of a top-down parser<footnote>
        <bibref>Lucas 1961</bibref>.
      </footnote>.
      Either Irons paper or this one can be considered to be
      the first description of recursive descent<footnote>
        <bibref>Grune and Jacobs 2008</bibref>
        call Lucas the discoverer of recursive descent.
        In fact, both
        <bibref>Irons 1961</bibref>
        and
        <bibref>Lucas 1961</bibref>
        are recursive descent with a major bottom-up element.
        Perhaps Grune and Jacobs based their decision on the Lucas' description of his algorithm,
        which talks about his parser's bottom-up element only briefly,
        while describing the top-down element in detail.
        Also, the Lucas algorithm more resembles modern implementations of recursive descent
        much more closely than
        <bibref>Irons 1961</bibref>.
        <br><br>
        In conversation, Irons described his 1961 parser as a kind of recursive descent.
        Peter Denning
        (<bibref>Denning 1983</bibref>)
        gives priority to Irons and,
        as a grateful former student of Irons,
        that is of course my preference on
        a personal basis.
      </footnote>.
      Except to say that he deals properly with them, Lucas does not say
      how he parses operator expressions.
      But it is easy to believe Lucas'
      claim -- by this time the techniques for
      parsing operator expressions are well understood<footnote>
        <bibref>Lucas 1961</bibref>

      algorithm<footnote>
        <bibref>Dijkstra 1961</bibref>.
      </footnote>.
      In Norvell's useful classification<footnote>
        <bibref>Norvell 1999</bibref>.
      </footnote>
      of operator expression parsers,
      all
      earlier parsers have been what he calls
      <q>the classic
        algorithm</q>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dijkstra's approach is new.
      In the classic approach,
      the number
      of levels of precedence is hard-coded into the
      algorithm.
      Dijkstra's algorithm can handle any number of levels
      of precedence without a change in its code,
      and without any effect on its running speed.

    <h1>The Operator Issue as of 1961</h1>
    <p>The results of 1961 transformed the Operator Issue.
      Before ALGOL,
      parsing operator expressions essentially
      <em>was</em>
      parsing.
      After ALGOL, almost all languages will be block-structured
      and ad hoc string manipulatons are no longer adequate --
      the language as a whole requires a serious parsing technique.
      Parsing operator expressions becomes a side show,
      or so it seems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why not use the
      algorithms that parse operator expressions for the whole
      language?
      <bibref>Samuelson and Bauer 1959</bibref>
      had suggested
      exactly that.
      But, alas, operator expression parsing is not adequate for
      languages as a whole<footnote>
        But see the entry for 1973 on Pratt parsing
        (<bibref>Pratt 1973</bibref>)
        where the idea of parsing
        entire languages as operator grammars is revisited.
      </footnote>.
    </p>
    <p>Also by 1961, we have BNF.
      This gives us a useful notation
      for describing grammars.
      It allows us to introduce our Basic Operator Grammar (BASIC-OP):
    </p>
    <ul id="g-basic-op">
      <li>S ::= E</li>
      <li>E ::= E + T</li>
      <li>E ::= T</li>
      <li>T ::= T * F</li>
      <li>T ::= F</li>
      <li>F ::= number</li>
    </ul>
    <p><a href="#g-basic-op">BASIC-OP</a>
      has two operators, three levels of precedence
      and left associativity.
      This was enough to challenge the primitive parsing techniques in use
      before 1961.
      Surprisingly, this simple grammar will continue to bedevil mainstream parsing theory for the
      next half a century.
    </p><p>
      Recursive descent, it turns out,
      cannot parse
      <a href="#g-basic-op">BASIC-OP</a>
      because it is left recursive.
      And that is not the end of it.
      Making addition and multiplication right-associate
      is unnatural and,
      as the authors of the IT compiler found out,
      causes users to revolt.
      But suppose we try to use this
      Right-recursive Operator Grammar (RIGHT-OP)
      anyway:
    </p>
    <ul id="g-right-op">
      <li>S ::= E</li>
      <li>E ::= T + E</li>
      <li>E ::= T</li>
      <li>T ::= F * T</li>
      <li>T ::= F</li>
      <li>F ::= number</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Recursive descent, without help,
      cannot parse
      <a href="#g-right-op">RIGHT-OP</a>.
      As of 1961,
      parsing theory has not developed well enough to
      state why in a precise terms.
      Suffice it to say for now
      that
      <a href="#g-rr">RIGHT-OP</a>
      requires too much lookahead.
    </p>
    <p>But recursive descent does have a huge advantage,
      one which, despite its severe limitations,
      will save it from obsolescence time and again.
      Hand-written recursive descent is essentially calling
      subroutines.
      Adding custom modification to recursive descent
      is very straight-forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition,
      while pure recursive descent cannot
      <em>parse</em>
      operator expressions,
      it can
      <em>recognize</em>
      them.
      This means pure recursive descent may not be able to create
      the parse subtree for an operator expression itself,
      but it can recognize the expression and hand control
      over to a specialized operator expression parser.
      This seems to be what Lucas' 1961 algorithm did,
      and it is certainly what many other implementations did afterwards.
      Adding the operator expression subparser makes the implementation
      only quasi-Chomskyan,
      but this was a price the profession has
      been willing to pay.
    </p>
    <p>Alternatively,
      a recursive descent implementation can parse operator expressions
      as lists,
      and add associativity in post-processing.
      This pushes some of the more important parsing
      out of the syntactic phase into the semantics
      but, once again,
      it seemed that
      Chomskyan purity had to be thrown overboard
      if the ship was to stay afloat.
    </p>
    <p>Bottom line: as of 1961 the Operator Issue takes a new form.
      Because of the Operator Issue,
      recursive descent is not
      sufficient for practical grammars -- it must always be part of a
      hybrid.
    </p>
    <p>In this context,
      Dijkstra's new 1961 algorithm is a welcome alternative:
      as an operator expression subparser,
      it can parse operator expressions faster and in less space.
      But Dijkstra's algorithm has no more parsing power
      than the classic operator
      precedence algorithm --
      it does nothing to change the basic tradeoffs.

      The LR algorithm is deterministic,
      Chomskyan and bottom-up. Knuth is primarily interested in the
      mathematics, and the parsing algorithm he gives is not practical. He
      leaves development of practical LR parsing algorithms as an
      <q>open question</q>

      <q>future research</q><footnote>

    <h1>Term: "linear"</h1>
    <p>
      Among
      <a href="#loc-quest">the goals</a>
      for the ideal
      ALGOL parser was that it be
      <q>efficient</q>.
      As of 1965 this notion becomes more precise,
      thanks to a notation that Knuth borrows from
      calculus.
      This
      <q>big O</q>
      notation characterizes algorithm's
      using functions, but it treats functions that
      differ by a constant multiple as identical<footnote>
        This timeline is not a mathematics tutorial,
        and I have ignored important complications to
        avoid digression.
        For interested readers,
        the details of "big O"
        notation can be
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation">worth learning
        </a>.
      </footnote>.
      <q>Ignoring the constant</q>
      means that conclusions
      drawn from
      <q>big O</q>
      results outlast steady improvements
      in technology,
      but capture non-linear jumps.
    </p>
    <p>
      These big O functions take as their input some aspect of the algorithm's
      input.
      In the case of parsing, by convention,
      the big O function is usually a function
      of the length of the input<footnote>
        Because constants are ignored, all reasonable measures of
        the length are equivalent for
        <q>big O</q>
        notation.
        Some papers on parsing also consider the size of the grammar,
        but usually size of the grammar is regarded as a fixed constant.
        In this timeline all
        <q>big O</q>
        results will be
        in terms of the input length.
      </footnote>.
      Of the many possible
      <q>big O</q>
      functions,
      only a few will be of interest in this timeline.
    </p><ul>
      <li>A function which grows steadily as the input grows
        is called
        <term>linear</term>.
        In
        <q>big O</q>
        notation,
        <term>linear</term>
        is
        written O(n).
      </li>
      <li>A function which grows as the length of the input times
        its logarithm is almost linear:
        <term>quasi-linear</term>.
        In
        <q>big O</q>
        notation,
        <term>quasi-linear</term>
        can be
        written O(n*log n).
      </li>
      <li>A function which grows as the square of the length
        is called
        <q>quadratic</q>
        -- O(n**2).
      </li>
      <li>A function which grows as the cube of the length
        is called
        <q>cubic</q>
        -- O(n**3).
      </li>
      <li>In extreme cases,
        a function can grow as a constant taken to the power
        of the length, or
        <term>exponentially</term>
        --
        O(c**n).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      By this time,
      <q>efficient</q>
      for a parser means
      <q>linear</q>
      or
      <q>quasi-linear</q>.
      Parsers which operate in quadratic, cubic, or exponential
      time are
      considered impractical.
      But parsers aimed at practitioners will often push the
      envelope --
      any parser which uses backtracking is potentially exponential
      and is designed in the (often disappointed) hope
      that the backtracking will not
      get out of hand
      for the grammar of interest to the user.

    <h1>The Operator Issue as of 1965</h1>
    <p><bibref>Knuth 1965</bibref>
      is a significant milestone
      in the history of operator expresssion parsing.
      Knuth specifically addresses the parsing of ALGOL
      and he zeroes in on its arithmetic expressions
      as the crucial issue<footnote>
        Knuth also discusses some ambiguities,
        and some intermixing of semantics with syntax,
        in the
        ALGOL report.
        But Knuth (quite appropriately)
        notes that BNF was new when it was written,
        and treats these other issues
        as problems with the ALGOL specification.
        (See
        <bibref>Knuth 1965</bibref>, pp. 622-625.)
      </footnote>.
      Knuth suggests a "typical" grammar<footnote>
        <bibref>Knuth 1965</bibref>, p. 621.
      </footnote>
      which is short,
      but encapsulates the parsing challenges
      presented by ALGOL's arithmetic expressions:
    </p><ul id="g-knuth-op">
      <li>S ::= E</li>
      <li>E ::= - T</li>
      <li>E ::= T</li>
      <li>E ::= E - T</li>
      <li>T ::= P</li>
      <li>T ::= T * P</li>
      <li>P ::= a</li>
      <li>P ::= ( E )</li>
    </ul>
    <p><a href="#g-knuth-op">KNUTH-OP</a>
      is left-recursive,
      allows parentheses,
      has three levels of precedence,
      and implements both unary and
      binary minus.
      Recursive descent cannot parse
      <a href="#g-knuth-op">KNUTH-OP</a>,
      but it is LR(1).
      The means that it is well within Knuth's new
      class of grammars and,
      by implication,
      probably within a practical subclass of the
      LR grammars.
    </p>
    <h1>An influential misconception</h1>
    <p>In his 1965, Knuth makes
      a reasonable assumption,
      but one which turns out to be wrong:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Another important area of research is to develop algorithms that
      accept LR(k) grammars, or special classes of them, and to mechanically
      produce efficient parsing programs.<footnote>
        <bibref>Knuth 1965</bibref>, p. 637.
      </footnote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Implied in this is
      the belief that
      better algorithms for parsing LR(k)
      grammars
      will either be parsers aimed specifically at LR(k)
      or at subsets of LR(k).
      That is, Knuth excludes the idea that algorithms which
      target
      <b>supersets</b>
      of LR(k) might be faster than those
      that take on LR(k) directly.
      In short, he assumes, as is usually the case,
      that as you gain in parsing power,
      you lose in terms of speed.
      That is a good rule of thumb,
      and a reasonable expectation,
      but it is not always true.
    </p>
    <p>A factor in this misconception may be another assumption:
      the most efficient way to parse a deterministic language
      is with a deterministic parser.
      Certainly all deterministic parsers are linear.
      And certainly all non-deterministic parsers can run
      in worse than quasi-linear time,
      at which point they quickly become impractical.
      But neither of these truths directly answers the question
      of practical interest:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Is there a non-deterministic parser which is linear for
      the LR(k) grammars, or a superset of them?
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      This question will be answered by Joop Leo in 1991.
      The answer, surprisingly, will be
      <q>yes</q>.
    </p>
    <h1>1968: Lewis and Stearns discover LL</h1>
    <p>When Knuth discovered the LR grammars, he announced them to
      the world with a full-blown mathematical description.
      The top-down
      grammars, which arose historically,
      have lacked such a description.
      In 1968,
      Lewis and Stearns fill that gap by defining the LL(k) grammars<footnote>
        <bibref>Lewis and Stearns 1968</bibref>.
        They are credited in
        <bibref>Rosencrantz and Stearns 1970</bibref>
        and
        <bibref>Aho and Ullman 1972</bibref>, p. 368.
      </footnote>.
    </p>
    <h1>Terms: "LL" and "LR"</h1>
    <p>When LL is added to the vocabulary of parsing, the meaning of
      <term>LR</term>
      shifts slightly. In 1965 Knuth meant LR to mean
      <q>translatable from left to right</q><footnote>
        <bibref>Knuth 1965</bibref>, p. 610.
        See also on p. 611
        "corresponds with the intuitive notion of translation
        from left to right looking k characters ahead".
      </footnote>.
      But LL means
      <q>scan from the left, using left reductions</q>
      and, in response, the meaning of LR shifts to become
      <q>scan from the left, using
        right reductions</q><footnote>
        <bibref>Knuth 1971</bibref>, p. 102.
        LL and LR have mirror images: RL means
        <q>scan from the right,
          using left reductions</q>
        and RR acquires its current meaning
        of
        <q>scan from the right, using right reductions</q>.
        Practical use of these
        mirror images is rare, but it may have occurred
        in one of the algorithms in our timeline
        --
        operator expression parsing
        in the IT compiler seems to have been RL(2) with backtracking.
      </footnote>.
    </p><p>If there is a number after the parentheses in this notation for
      parsing algorithms, it usually indicates the number of tokens of
      lookahead.
      As an example, LL(1) means
      <q>scan from the
        left, using left reductions with one character of lookahead</q>.
      LL(1) will be important in what follows.
    </p>
    <h1>The Operator Issue as of 1968</h1>
    <p>
      With
      <bibref>Knuth 1965</bibref>
      and
      <bibref>Lewis and Stearns 1968</bibref>,
      we can now restate the problem with recursive descent
      and operator expressions in precise terms:
      Recursive descent
      in its pure form,
      is LL(1).
      Arithmetic operator grammars are not LL(1) -- not even close.
      In fact,
      of the grammars
      <a href="#g-basic-op">BASIC-OP</a>,
      <a href="#g-right-op">RIGHT-OP</a>,
      and
      <a href="#g-knuth-op">KNUTH-OP</a>,
      none is LL(k) for any k.
    </p>
    <p>
      Compromises have to be made
      if we are parsing with recursive descent.
      As one result of these compromises,
      truly
      declarative versions of LL(1) are not used.
      A pure declarative
      LL(1) parser generator
      <em>could</em>
      be written, but it would not be able to parse arithmetic expressions
      properly.
    </p>
    <p>As mentioned, a common compromise is to have recursive descent parse
      arithmetic expressions as lists,
      and add associativity in post-processing.
      We are now able to look at this in more detail.
      An extended BNF grammar to recognize
      <a href="#g-basic-op">BASIC-OP</a>
      as a list is as follows:
    </p><pre id="g-elist-op"><tt>
      S  ::= E
      E  ::= T { TI }*
      TI ::= '+' T
      T  ::= F { FI } *
      FI ::= 'x' F
      F  ::= number
    </tt></pre><p>
      In the above
      <tt>{Z}*</tt>
      means
      <q>zero or more occurences of Z</q>.
      Expanded into pure BNF,
      and avoiding empty right hand sides,
      our operator "list" grammar becomes
      LIST-OP:
    </p><pre id="g-list-op"><tt>
      S  ::= E
      E  ::= T TL
      E  ::= T
      TL ::= TI
      TL ::= TI TL
      TI ::= '+' T
      T  ::= F FL
      T  ::= F
      FL ::= FI
      FL ::= FI FL
      FI ::= 'x' F
      F  ::= number
    </tt></pre>
    <p><a href="g-list=op">LIST-OP</a>
      is LL(1),
      and therefore can be parsed directly
      by recursive descent.
      Note that in
      <a href="g-list-op">LIST-OP</a>,
      although associativity must be provided by a post-processor,
      the grammar enforces precedence.

    <h1>1968: Earley's algorithm</h1>
    <p>Jay Earley discovers the algorithm named after him<footnote>
        <bibref>Earley 1968</bibref>.
      </footnote>.
      Like the Irons
      algorithm, Earley's algorithm is Chomskyan, declarative and fully
      general. Unlike the Irons algorithm, it does not backtrack. Earley's
      algorithm is both top-down and bottom-up at once -- it uses dynamic
      programming and keeps track of the parse in tables. Earley's approach
      makes a lot of sense and looks very promising indeed, but
      it has
      three serious issues:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>First, there is a bug in the handling of zero-length rules.</li>
      <li>Second, it is quadratic for right recursions.</li>
      <li>Third, the bookkeeping required to set up the tables is,
        by the standards of 1968 hardware, daunting.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>1968: Attribute grammars</h1>
    <p>Irons' synthetic attributes had always been inadequate for many
      tasks.
      Until now, they had been supplemented by side effects or state
      variables.
      In 1968,
      Knuth publishes a paper on a concept he had been working for the
      previous few years: inherited attributes<footnote>
        <bibref>Knuth 1968</bibref>.
      </footnote>.
    </p>
    <h1>Term: "Inherited attributes"</h1>
    <p>Recall that a node in a parse
      gets its synthetic attributes from
      its children. Inherited attributes are attibutes
      that a node gets from
      its parents.
      Of course, if both inherited and synthetic attributes
      are used, there are potential circularities.
      But
      inherited attributes are powerful and, with care, the circularities
      can be avoided.</p>
    <h1>Term: "Attribute grammar"</h1>
    <p>An attribute grammar is a grammar whose nodes may have both inherited and synthetic attributes.</p>
    <h1>1969: LALR</h1>
    <p>Since
      <bibref>Knuth 1965</bibref>
      many have taken up his challenge to find a
      practically parseable subset of the LR(k) languages.
      In 1969,
      Frank DeRemer describes a new variant of Knuth's LR
      parsing<footnote>
        <bibref>DeRemer 1969</bibref>
      </footnote>.
      DeRemer's LALR algorithm requires only a stack and a state
      table of quite manageable size.
      LALR looks practical,
      and can parse
      <a href="#g-knuth-op">KNUTH-OP</a>.
      LALR will go on to become the most widely used of the LR(k)
      subsets.

    <h1>1973: Pratt parsing</h1>
    <p>As we have noted pure LL(1) cannot parse operator expressions,
      and so operator expression parsers are often called into service
      as subparsers.
      What about
      making the entire grammar an operator grammar?
      This idea had already occurred to Samuelson and Bauer in 1959.
      In 1973, Vaughan Pratt revives it<footnote>
        <bibref>Pratt 1973</bibref>.
      </footnote>.
    </p>
    <p>There are problems with switching to operator
      grammars.
      Operator grammars are non-Chomskyan -- the BNF no longer
      accurately describes the grammar.
      Instead the BNF becomes part of
      a combined notation, and the actual grammar parsed depends also on
      precedence, associativity,
      and semantics.
      And operator grammars have a very restricted
      form -- most practical languages are not operator grammars.</p>
    <p>But many practical grammars are almost operator grammars. And the
      Chomskyan approach has always had its dissenters.
      Vaughn Pratt is one
      of these, and discovers a new approach
      to operator expression parsing:
      Pratt parsing is the third and last approach in
      Theodore
      Norvell's taxonomy of approaches to operator expression
      parsing<footnote>
        <bibref>Norvell 1999</bibref>.
      </footnote>.
      Some have adopted Pratt parsing
      as the overall solution to their parsing problems<footnote>
        <bibref>Pratt 1973</bibref>, p. 51.
      </footnote>.
    </p>
    <p>As of 2018, the Pratt approach
      is not popular as an overall strategy.
      Under the name precedence climbing,
      it is most often used
      as a subparser within a recursive descent strategy.
      All
      operator expression subparsers break the Chomskyan paradigm so the
      non-Chomskyan nature of Pratt's parser is not a problem in this
      context.

    <h1>The Operator Issue as of 1979</h1>
    <p>
      Recall
      <a href="#loc-quest">the criteria</a>
      outlined for a solution
      of the Parsing Problem:
      that the parser be
      efficient, practical, declarative and general.
      LALR is linear and runs fast on 1979 hardware.
      As of 1979 LALR seems practical.
      And LALR is declarative.
      True, LALR is very far from general,
      but
      <a href="g-basic-op">BASIC-OP</a>,
      <a href="g-right-op">RIGHT-OP</a>
      <a href="g-right-op">KNUTH-OP</a>
      and
      <a href="g-right-op">LIST-OP</a>
      are all LALR,
      and LALR can parse
      most operator expressions directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not all of the criteria
      of the original quest have been
      fully met.
      Nonetheless,
      after two decades of research,
      it seems as if the Parsing Problem
      and the Operator Issue
      can both be declared solved.

    <h1>1990: Monads</h1>
    <p>
      Wadler starts to introduce monads to the functional programming community.
      As one example he converts his previous efforts at function parsing
      techniques to monads<footnote>
        <bibref>Walder 1990</bibref>
      </footnote>.
      The parsing technique is pure recursive descent.
      The examples shown for monadic parsing are very simple,
      and do not include operator expressions.
      In his earlier non-monadic work, Wadler uses a very restricted form of operator expression:
      His grammar avoided left recursion by using parentheses,
      and operator precedence was not implemented
      <footnote>
        <bibref>Wadler 1985</bibref>.

    <h1>1991: Leo's speed-up of Earley's algorithm</h1>
    <p>Joop Leo discovers a way of speeding up right recursions in
      Earley's algorithm<footnote>
        <bibref>Leo 1991</bibref>.
      </footnote>. Leo's algorithm is linear for just about every
      unambiguous grammar of practical interest, and many ambiguous ones
      as well. In 1991 hardware is six orders of magnitude faster than
      1968 hardware, so that the issue of bookkeeping overhead had receded
      in importance. This is a major discovery. When it comes to speed,
      the game has changed in favor of the Earley algorithm.</p>
    <h1>Knuth's influential misconception revisited</h1>
    <p>Recall that
      <bibref>Knuth 1965</bibref>, in suggesting lines of future research,
      had excluded the possibility that a parser of a superset of the LR(k) languages
      could be practical and linear.
      Knuth did not conclude this carelessly --
      he proved a strong relationship between the
      <term>deterministic languagues</term>
      of previous theory,
      and the language defined by his new LR(k) model.
      Knuth's argument was highly suggestive,
      so much so that most took it as a proof.
    </p>
    <p>But it was not a proof --
      Earley's non-deterministic algorithm,
      while not linear in general,
      <b>is</b>
      linear for a superset of Knuth's LR(k) grammars.
      Is it practical?
      At this point, Earley parsing is almost forgotten,
      and few take notice of Earley's discovery.
      Two decades will pass before anyone
      attempts a practical implementation of
      <bibref>Leo 1991</bibref>.
    </p>
    <h1>The Operator Issue as of 1991</h1>
    <p>Earley's is forgotten. So everyone in LALR-land is content,
      right? Wrong. In fact, far from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As of 1979, LALR seemed practical.
      But by the 1990s users of LALR are making
      unpleasant discoveries.
      While LALR automatically generates their
      parsers, debugging them is so hard they could just as easily write the
      parser by hand.
      Once debugged, their LALR parsers are fast for correct
      inputs.
      But almost all they tell the users about incorrect inputs
      is that they are incorrect.
      In Larry's words, LALR is
      <q>fast
        but stupid</q><footnote>

    </p>
    <p>
      On the written record, the discontent with LALR and
      <tt>yacc</tt>
      is hard to find.
      What programmer wants to announce to colleagues and
      potential employers that he cannot figure
      how to make the standard state-of-the-art tool work?
      But, by 1991,
      a movement away from LALR has already begun.
      Parsing practice falls back on
      recursive descent
      and the Operator Issue
      is back in full force.
    </p>
    <h1>1992: Combinator parsing</h1>
    <p>
      Combinator parsing
      was introduced in two 1992 papers<footnote>
        Some sources consider
        <bibref>Wadler 1985</bibref>
        an
        early presentation of the ideas of combinator parsing.
        In assigning priority here,
        I follow
        <bibref>Grune and Jacobs 2008</bibref>
        (p. 564).
      </footnote>.
      Of more interest
      to us is the one by Hutton, which focuses on combinator parsing<footnote>
        The paper which is devoted to parsing is
        <bibref>Hutton 1992</bibref>.
        The other paper, which centers on combinators as a programming
        paradigm, is
        <bibref>Frost 1992</bibref>.
        Frost only mentions parsing in one paragraph, and
        that focuses on implementation issues.
        Some of his grammars include operator expressions,
        but these avoid left recursion,
        and implement precedence and associativity,
        using parentheses.
      </footnote>.
      As Hutton explains<footnote>
        <bibref>Hutton 1992</bibref>, p. 5.
      </footnote>
      a combinator is an attribute grammar
      with one inherited attribute (the input string)
      and two synthesized attributes (the value of the node
      and the remaining part of the input string).
      Combinators can be
      <q>combined</q>
      to compose other parsers.
      This allows you to have an algebra of parsers.
      It's an extremely attractive idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      But,
      exciting as the new mathematics is,
      the underlying parsing theory contains
      nothing new --
      it is the decades-old recursive descent,
      unchanged.
      Hutton's example language is extremely basic --
      his operator expressions require left association,
      but not precedence.
      Left association is implemented by post-processing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hutton's main presentation does not use monads.
      In his final pages, however,
      Hutton points out
      <q>combinator parsers give rise to a monad</q>
      and shows
      how his presentation could be rewritten in a form
      closely related to monads<footnote>
        <bibref>Hutton 1992</bibref>, pp. 19-20.
      </footnote>.
    </p>
    <h1>1995: Wadler's monads</h1>
    <p>
      In the adaptation of monads into the world of
      programming,
      <bibref>Walder 1995</bibref>
      is a turning point.
      One of Wadler's examples is a parser based on
      monads and combinator parsing.
      Combinator parsing becomes the standard
      example of monad programming.
    </p>
    <p>In its monadic form,
      the already attractive technique of combinator parsing is extremely elegant
      and certainly seems as if it
      <em>should</em>
      solve all parsing problems.
      But, once again, it is still recursive descent,
      completely unchanged.
      Wadler handles left recursion by parsing into
      a list, and re-processing that list
      into left recursive form.
      Wadler's example grammar only has one operator,
      so the issue of precedence does not arise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of one paradigm to solve them all,
      Wadler ends up with a two layered approach,
      with a hackish bottom layer and an awkward interface.
      This undercuts
      the simplicity and elegance of the combinator approach.
    </p>
    <h1>1996: Hutton and Meijer on combinator parsing</h1>
    <p>
      <bibref>Wadler 1995</bibref>
      used parsing as an example to motivate
      its presentation of monads.
      Graham Hutton and Erik Meijer<footnote>
        <bibref>Hutton and Meijer 1996</bibref>.
      </footnote>
      take the opposite perspective -- they
      write a paper on combinator parsing that could
      <q>also be viewed as a first introduction to the use
        of monads in programming.</q><footnote>
        <bibref>Hutton and Meijer 1996</bibref>,
        p. 3.
      </footnote>
    </p>
    <p>The most complicated grammar<footnote>
        <bibref>Hutton and Meijer 1996</bibref>, p. 18.
        A simpler arithmetic expression grammar on p. 15 raises no issues
        not present in the more complicated example.
      </footnote>
      for operator expressions in
      <bibref>Hutton and Meijer 1996</bibref>
      has two operators (exponentiation and addition)
      with two levels of precedence
      and two different associativities:
      exponentiation associates right
      and
      addition associates left.
    </p>
    <p>
      The solution in
      <bibref>Hutton and Meijer 1996</bibref>
      will
      be familiar by now:
      Precedence is provided by the combinator parser
      which parses operators and operands of the same
      precedence into lists.
      Associativity is provided by re-processing the
      lists.
    </p>
    <h1>The Operator Issue as of 1996</h1>
    <p>As we have seen,
      the literature introducing monads and combinator
      parsing added nothing to what was already known
      about parsing algorithms.
      We have focused on it for three reasons:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Functional programming has had a profound influence
        on the way the profession sees parsing.
        That influence will probably grow.
      </li>
      <li>The literature shows
        the relative popularity among
        one group of highly skilled programmers
        of LALR and recursive descent.
        LALR is not mentioned once in any of the
        articles surveyed.
      </li>
      <li>
        The functional programming literature
        shows that the
        Operator Issue,
        once thought solved,
        is as live an issue in the 1990's
        as it was at the end of 1961.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>2000: The Perl 6 effort begins</h1>
    <p>Larry Wall decides on a radical reimplementation of Perl --
      Perl 6. Larry does not even consider using LALR again.</p>
    <h1>2002: Aycock and Horspool solve Earley's zero-length rule problem</h1>
    <p>John Aycock and R. Nigel Horspool publish their attempt at a
      fast, practical Earley's parser<footnote>
        <bibref>Aycock and Horspool 2002</bibref>.
      </footnote>. Missing from it is Joop Leo's
      improvement -- they seem not to be aware of it. Their own speedup
      is limited in what it achieves and the complications it introduces
      can be counter-productive at evaluation time. But buried in their
      paper is a solution to the zero-length rule bug. And this time the
      solution requires no additional bookkeeping.</p>
    <h1>2004: PEG</h1>
    <p>Implementers by now are avoiding
      <tt>yacc</tt>, but the demand for
      declarative parsers remains.
      In 2004,
      Bryan Ford<footnote>
        <bibref>Ford 2004</bibref>.
        See also
        <bibref>Ford 2002</bibref>.
      </footnote>
      fills this gap by
      repackaging the nearly-forgotten GTDPL.
      Ford's new algorithm,
      PEG,
      is declarative, always linear,
      and has an attractive new syntax.</p>
    <p>
      But PEG is, in fact, pseudo-declarative --
      it uses the BNF notation,
      but it does not parse the BNF grammar described by the notation:
      PEG achieves unambiguity by finding only a subset of the parses
      of its BNF grammar.
      And, as with its predecessor GTDPL,
      in practice it is usually impossible to determine what the subset
      is.
      This means that the best a programmer
      usually can
      do is to create a test suite and fiddle with the PEG description
      until it passes.
      Problems not covered
      by the test suite will be encountered at runtime.
    </p>
    <p>
      PEG takes the old joke that
      <q>the code is
        the documentation</q>
      one step further --
      with PEG it is often the case that
      nothing documents the grammar,
      not even the code.
      Under this circumstance, creating reliable software is impossible.
      As it is usually used,
      PEG is the nitroglycerin of LL(1) parsing --
      slightly more powerful, but too dangerous to be worth it.
    </p>
    <p>
      PEG, in safe use, would essentially be LL(1)<footnote>
        <bibref>Mascrenhas et al 2014</bibref>.
        My account of PEG is negative because almost all
        real-life PEG practice is unsafe,
        and almost all of the literature offers no cautions
        against unsafe use of PEG.
        Ford's PEG is efficient
        and does in fact have real, if niche, uses.
        Programmers interested in the safe use of PEG should
        consult
        <bibref>Mascrenhas et al 2014</bibref>.
      </footnote>.
      Those adventurous souls who parse operator expressions under
      PEG typically seem to parse the operator expressions as lists,
      and re-process them in the semantics.

    <p>
      For three decades, the industry's flagship C compilers have

    <h1>2010: Leo 1991 is implemented</h1>
    <p>Jeffrey Kegler (the author of this timeline) releases the first
      practical implementation of Joop Leo's algorithm<footnote>
        <bibref>Kegler 2010</bibref>.
      </footnote>.
      The new parser, named Marpa, is general, declarative
      and linear for all the grammars discussed in
      <bibref>Knuth 1965</bibref>, that is, it is
      linear for the LR(k) grammars for all finite k<footnote>
        In fact,
        <bibref>Leo 1991</bibref>
        proves his algorithm,
        and therefore Marpa,
        is linear for the LR-regular
        grammars -- the LR grammars with infinite lookahead, so long as the lookahead
        is a regular expresion.
        It is not known (in fact not decidable, see
        <bibref>Leo 1991</bibref>, p. 175.),
        just how large a class of grammars
        Marpa is linear for.
        But it is known that there are both ambiguous and unambiguous grammars
        for which Marpa is not linear.
        In the general case, Marpa obeys the bounds of Earley's algorithm --
        it is worst-case O(n**2) for unambiguous grammars;
        and worst-case O(n**3) for ambiguous grammars.
        On the other hand, Marpa follows
        <bibref>Leo 1991</bibref>
        in being linear for many ambiguous grammars,
        including those of most practical interest.
      </footnote>.
      This means it is also linear for most of the grammar classes we have discussed in this
      timeline.

      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is a vast class of grammars,
      and it has the important feature that a programmer
      can readily determine if their grammar is linear under Marpa.
      Marpa will parse a grammar in linear time, if
    </p><ul id="loc-linearity-rules">
      <li>It is unambiguous<footnote>
          In the general case, ambiguity is undecidable, but
          in practice it is usually straight-forward for a programmer
          to determine that the grammar he wants is unambiguous.
          Note the while the general case is undecidable,
          Marpa will tell the programmer if a parse
          (a grammar with a particular input)
          is ambiguous and, since it parses ambiguous
          grammars, produces an error message showing where the ambiguity is.

          that shows where the middle of a middle recursion is,
          without having to go to the end and count back.
          Whether or not a grammar is unmarked is, in general,
          an undecidable problem.
          But in practice, there is a easy rule:
          if a person can
          <q>eyeball</q>
          the middle of a long
          middle recursion, and does not need to count from both

      <li>It has no ambiguous right recursions<footnote>
          This is a very pedantic requirement,
          which practical programmers can in fact ignore.
          Any programmer who has found and eliminated
          ambiguities in his grammar will usually,
          in the process,
          also have found and
          eliminated ambiguous right recursions,
          since it is far easier to eliminate them than
          to determine is they create a overall ambiguity.
          In fact,
          it is an open question whether there
          <em>are</em>
          any unambiguous
          grammars with ambiguous right recursions --
          neither Joop Leo or I know of any.
        </footnote>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The ability to ensure that a grammar can
      be parsed in linear time is highly useful for second-order
      languages --
      a programmer can easily ensure that all his
      automatically generated grammars will be practical.
      Marpa's own DSL will make use of second-order programming.

      <bibref>Leo 1991</bibref>
      did not address the zero-length
      rule problem.
      Kegler solves it by adopting the solution of
      <bibref>Aycock and Horspool 2002</bibref>.
      Finally,
      in an effort to combine the best of declarative and hand-written parsing,
      Kegler reorders Earley's parse engine so that it
      allows procedural logic.
      As a side effect,
      this gives Marpa excellent error-handling properties.

    <h1>2012: General precedence parsing</h1>
    <p>
      While the purely
      precedence-driven parsing of
      <bibref>Samuelson and Bauer 1960</bibref>
      and
      <bibref>Pratt 1973</bibref>
      never caught on,
      the use of precedence in parsing remains popular.
      In fact, precedence tables often occur in documentation
      and standards,
      which is a clear sign that they too can play a role
      in human-readable but precise descriptions of grammars.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2012, Kegler releases a version of Marpa which allows
      the user to mix Chomskyan and precedence parsing at will<footnote>
        <bibref>Kegler 2012a</bibref>.
      </footnote>.
      Marpa's
      <q>precedenced statements</q>
      describe expressions
      in terms of precedence and association.
      If
      <q>precedenced statements</q>
      are added to a grammar that Marpa parses in linear
      time, then the grammar remains linear as long as the precedenced statements
      are (after precedence is taken in consideration) unambiguous<footnote>
        Internally, Marpa rewrites precedenced statements into BNF.
        Marpa's rewrite does not use middle recursions
        and does not introduce any new ambiguities
        so that, following Marpa's
        <a href="#loc-linearity-rules">linearity
          rules</a>, the result must be linear.
      </footnote>.
    </p><p>Here is an example of a Marpa
      <q>precedenced statement</q>:
      <footnote>
        In this, precedence goes from tightest to loosest.
        Single bars (<tt>|</tt>) separate RHS's of equal precedence.
        Double bars (<tt>||</tt>) separate RHS's of different precedence.
        Associativity defaults to left,
        and exceptions are indicated by the value of the
        <tt>assoc</tt>
        adverb.
        Note that these
        <q>precedenced statements</q>,
        like all of Marpa's DSL,
        are parsed by Marpa itself.
        The statement shown has the semantic adverbs removed for clarity.
        The original is part of the
        <bibref>Marpa::R2</bibref>
        test suite
        and can be found in
        <a href=
	    "https://metacpan.org/pod/release/JKEGL/Marpa-R2-4.000000/pod/Scanless/DSL.pod"
	    >
          the Marpa documentation</a>.
      </footnote>
    </p>
    <pre><tt>
              Expression ::=
                 Number

    <p>Previously operator expression parsers had worked by
      comparing adjacent operators.
      This limited them to binary expressions
      (the ternary expressions in most languages are
      implemented using post-parsing hackery).
      Marpa's
      <q>precedenced expressions</q>
      are not operator-driven --
      operators are used only to avoid ambiguity.
      <q>Precedenced statements</q>
      will directly implement any number of ternary,
      quaternary or n-ary operators.
      Ternary and larger expressions are useful in
      financial calculations,
      and are common in calculus.
    </p>
    <h1>The Operator Issue as of 2012</h1>
    <p>Marpa allows operator expressions to be parsed as BNF,
      eliminating the need for them.
      On the other hand,
      Marpa's ability to handle second-order languages
      allows it to take statements which describe expressions
      in terms of precedence and association,
      and rewrite them in a natural way into Chomskyan form.
      In this way the grammar writer has all
      the benefits of Chomskyan parsing,
      but is also allowed to describe his grammar in terms
      of operators
      when that is convenient.
      Once again, the Operator Issue seems to be solved,
      but this time perhaps for real.
    </p>
    <h1>The Parsing Problem as of 2012</h1>
    <p>
      Again recall the four criteria from the original quest
      for a solution to the Parsing Problem:
      that a parser be efficient, practical, declarative and general.
      Does Marpa<footnote>
        <bibref>Marpa::R2</bibref>.
      </footnote>
      fulfill them?
    </p>
    <p>At first glance, no.
      While Marpa is general, it is not linear or quasi-linear for the
      general case,
      and therefore cannot be considered efficient enough.
      But to be general, a parser has to parse
      <b>every</b>
      context-free grammar, including
      some wildly ambiguous ones, for which simply printing the
      list of possible parses takes exponential time.
      With the experience of the decades,
      linearity for a fully general BNF parser seems to
      be a superfluous requirement for a practical parser.
    </p>
    <p>
      The LR(k) grammars include every
      other grammar class we have discussed --
      LL(k) for all k,
      LALR,
      operator grammars,
      etc.
      If we change our criteria as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>linear for all LR(k) grammars,
        and for all grammars parseable in linear time by any
        other parser in practical use;
      </li>
      <li>practical; and</li>
      <li>declarative.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      then Marpa qualifies.
    </p>
    <p>My teachers came from the generation which created the ALGOL vision
      and started the quest for a solution to the Parsing Problem.
      Alan Perlis was one of them.
      Would he have accepted my claim that I have found the solution to the
      problem he posed?
      I do not know,
      but I am certain,
      as anyone else who knew him can attest,
      that he would given me a plain-spoken answer.
      In that spirit, I submit this timeline to the candid reader.
      In any case,
      I hope
      that my reader has found this journey
      through the history of parsing informative.
