    <h1>4th BCE: Pannini's description of Sanskrit</h1>
    <p>In India, Pannini creates an exact and complete description of
      the Sanskrit language, including pronunciation. Sanskrit could be
      recreated using nothing but Pannini's grammar.
      Pannini's grammar is
      probably the first formal system of any kind, predating Euclid. Even
      today, nothing like it exists for any other natural language of
      comparable size or corpus. Pannini is the object of serious study
      today. But in the 1940's and 1950's Pannini is almost unknown in
      the West. It will have no direct effect on the other events in
      this timeline.

    <h1>1906: Markov's chains</h1>
    <p>Andrey Markov introduces his
      <term>chains</term>
      -- a set of
      states with transitions between them.
      One offshoot of Markov's work will be what we now
      know as regular expressions.
      Markov uses his chains, not
      for parsing, but for solving problems in probability<a id="footnote-1-ref" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>.

    <h1>1943: Post's rewriting system</h1>
    <p>Emil Post defines and studies a formal rewriting system<a id="footnote-2-ref" href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>
      using productions.
      With this, the process of rediscovering Pannini in the
      West begins.</p>
    <h1>1945: Turing discovers stacks</h1>
    <p>Alan Turing discovers the stack as part of his design of the
      ACE machine. This is important in parsing because recursive parsing
      requires stacks. The importance of Turing's discovery is not noticed
      at the time and stacks will be re-discovered many times over the
      next two decades<a id="footnote-3-ref" href="#footnote-3">[3]</a>.

      paper, Shannon makes an attempt to model English using Andrey Markov's
      chains<a id="footnote-5-ref" href="#footnote-5">[5]</a>.

    <h1>1949: Rutishauser's compiler</h1>
    <p>From 1949 to 1951 at the ETH Zurich, Heinz Rutishauser worked on
      the design of what we would now call a compiler<a id="footnote-6-ref" href="#footnote-6">[6]</a>.
      Rutishauser's arithmetic expression parser
      did not honor precedence but it does allow nested parentheses.
      It is perhaps the first algorithm which can really be considered a
      parsing method.
      Rutishauser's compiler was never implemented.</p>
    <h1>The Operator Issue as of 1949</h1>
    <p>
      In the form of arithmetic expressions, operator expressions
      are the target of the first efforts at automatic parsing.
      Perhaps surprising, we will not see this issue go away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very informally<a id="footnote-7-ref" href="#footnote-7">[7]</a>,
      we can say that
      an operator expression is an expression
      built up from operands
      and operators.
      It is expected that the operand might be another operator expression,
      so operator expressions raise the issue of recursion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The archetypal examples of operator expressions are arithmetic expressions:
    </p><pre><tt>
         2+(3*4)
         13^2^-5*9/11
         1729-42*8675309
      </tt></pre>
    <p>
      In Western mathematics arithmetic expressions were read
      according to traditional<a id="footnote-8-ref" href="#footnote-8">[8]</a>
      ideas of
      associativity and precedence:
    </p><ul>
      <li><tt>^</tt>
        is exponentiation.
        It right associates and has tightest<a id="footnote-9-ref" href="#footnote-9">[9]</a>
        precedence.
      </li>
      <li>
        Multiplication (<tt>*</tt>) and division (<tt>/</tt>) left associate.
        They have a precedence equal to each other
        and less tight than that of exponentiation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Addition ('+') and subtraction ('-') left associate.
        They have a precedence equal to each other
        and less tight than that of multiplication and division.
      </li>
      <li>
        Parentheses, when present, override the traditional
        associativity and precedence.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Certainly in the first attempts at parsing in compilers,
      arithmetic expressions are central.
      The first compiled languages are organized line-by-line and,
      except for arithmetic expressions,
      lines are
      interpreted using basic string manipulations.
      It is only when those string manipulations turn to dealing
      with arithmetic expressions that they become sophisticated
      enough to be called parsing techniques,
      and only then that
      having a parsing theory to describe them becomes helpful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rutishauser's language, and in fact all languages before
      LISP,
      is structured line-by-line.
      No language before ALGOL is truly block-structured.
    </p>
    <p>
      The line-by-line languages
      are parsed using string manipulations.
      A parsing theory is not helpful for describing these
      ad hoc string manipulations,
      so they don't give rise to one.
      The only logic in these early compilers that really deserves to be called
      a parsing method,
      is that which tackles arithmetic expressions.
    </p><p>
    </p>
    <h1>1950: Boehm's compiler</h1>
    <p>During 1950, Corrado Boehm, also at the ETH Zurich develops his
      own compiler.
      Rutishauser and Boehm are working at the same institution at the same
      time, but Boehm is unaware of Rutishauser's work until his own is
      complete.
      Boehm's is also the first self-compiling compiler -- it is written
      in its own language.
      </p>
      <p>
      Like Rutishauser, Boehm's language is line-by-line and
      parsed ad hoc, except for expressions. Boehm's expression parser
      <em>does</em>
      honor precedence, making it perhaps the first operator precedence
      parser<a id="footnote-10-ref" href="#footnote-10">[10]</a>.
      Boehm's compiler also allows parentheses, but the two cannot
      be mixed -- an expression can either be parsed using precedence
      or have parentheses, but not both.</p>
      And like Rutishauser's, Boehm's compiler is never
      implemented<a id="footnote-11-ref" href="#footnote-11">[11]</a>.

    <h1>1952: Grace Hopper uses the term <term>compiler</term></h1>
    <p>Grace Hopper writes a linker-loader.
      <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_compiler_construction#First_compilers%22">She
        calls it a <term>compiler</term></a>. Hopper seems to be the first
      person to use this term for a computer program.</p>
    <h1>Term: <term>Compiler</term> as of 1952</h1>
    <p>Hopper used the term <term>compiler</term> in a meaning it
      had at the time: <q>to compose out of materials from other
      documents</q><a id="footnote-12-ref" href="#footnote-12">[12]</a>.
      Specifically, before Hopper, the task we now see as
      <q>compiling</q> was then seen putting together a set of
      pre-existing assembler subroutines and calling them. Hopper's new
      program went one step further -- instead of calling the subroutines
      it expanded them (or in other words <q>compiled</q> them) into
      a single program. Since Hopper the term has acquired a different
      and very specialized meaning in the computer field. Today we would
      not call Hopper's program a <term>compiler</term><a id="footnote-13-ref" href="#footnote-13">[13]</a>.
    </p><p>There were compilers written or described before Hopper,
      but nobody called them compilers -- compiling in our modern sense
      was called
      <q>automatic coding</q>,
      <q>codification automatique</q>
      or
      <q>Rechenplanfertigung</q><a id="footnote-14-ref" href="#footnote-14">[14]</a>.
    </p><h1>1952: Glennie's AUTOCODE</h1>
    <p>Knuth
      Knuth and Pardo 1976,
      p 42.
      calls Glennie's the first
      <q>real</q><a id="footnote-15-ref" href="#footnote-15">[15]</a>
      compiler, by which he means that
      it was actually implemented and used by someone to translate
      algebraic statements into machine language.
      Glennie's AUTOCODE
      was very close to the machine -- too close to implement operator expressions.
      AUTOCODE was hard-to-use, and had little impact on
      other users of its target -- the Manchester Mark I.
      And because
      Glennie worked for the British atomic weapons projects his papers
      were routinely classified, so that the influence of AUTOCODE was
      slow to spread. Nonetheless, many other
      <term>compilers</term>
      afterward were named AUTOCODE, and this probably indicates some
      awareness of Glennie's effort<a id="footnote-16-ref" href="#footnote-16">[16]</a>.
    </p>
    <h1>1954: The FORTRAN project begins</h1>
    <p>At IBM, a team under John Backus begins working on the language which will be called FORTRAN.</p>
    <h1><term>Compiler</term> as of 1954</h1>
    <p>As of 1954, the term <term>compiler</term> was still being used
      in Hopper's looser sense, instead of its modern, specialized,
      one. In particular, there was no implication that the output of a
      <term>compiler</term> is ready for execution by a computer.<a id="footnote-17-ref" href="#footnote-17">[17]</a>
      The output of one 1954 <term>compiler</term>, for example, produced
      relative addresses, which needed to be translated by hand before
      a machine can execute them.</p>
    <h1>1955: Noam Chomsky starts teaching at MIT</h1>
    <p>Noam Chomsky is awarded a Ph.D. in linguistics and accepts a
      teaching post at MIT. MIT does not have a linguistics department and
      Chomsky is free to teach his own approach,
      Chomksy's linguistics course is
      highly original and very mathematical.</p>
    <h1>1955: Work begins on the IT compiler</h1>
    <p>At Purdue, a team including Alan Perlis and Joseph Smith begins work
      on the IT compiler<a id="footnote-18-ref" href="#footnote-18">[18]</a>.
    </p>
    <h1>1956: The IT compiler is released</h1>
    <p>Perlis and Smith, now at the Carnegie Institute of Technology,
      finish the IT compiler. Don Knuth calls this
    </p><blockquote>
      the first really
      <em>useful</em>
      compiler. IT and IT's derivatives were used successfully and
      frequently in hundreds of computer installations until [its
      target,] the [IBM] 650 became obsolete. [... P]previous systems
      were important steps along the way, but none of them had the
      combination of powerful language and adequate implementation and
      documentation needed to make a significant impact in the use of
      machines.<a id="footnote-19-ref" href="#footnote-19">[19]</a>.
    </blockquote>
    <p>The IT language had arithmetic expressions, of a sort --
      parentheses are honored, but otherwise evaluation is always
      right-to-left -- there is no operator precedence. IT did honor
      parentheses, but nonetheless its way of doing arithmetic expressions
      proves very unpopular: Donald Knuth reports that <q>The lack of
      operator priority (often called precedence or hierarchy) in the IT
      language was the most frequent single cause of errors by the users
      of that compiler.</q><a id="footnote-20-ref" href="#footnote-20">[20]</a>
    </p>
    <h1><term>Compiler</term> as of 1956</h1>
    <p>In the 1956 document describing the IT compiler<a id="footnote-21-ref" href="#footnote-21">[21]</a>,
      IT team is careful to define the term. Their definition makes clear that
      they are using of the word
      <term>compiler</term>
      in something like its
      modern sense, perhaps for the first time. From this time on, when used
      as a technical term within computing,
      <term>compiler</term>
      will usually
      mean what we currently understand it to mean.</p>
    <h1>1956: The Chomsky hierarchy</h1>
    <p>Chomsky publishes the paper which is usually considered the foundation of Western formal language theory.<a id="footnote-22-ref" href="#footnote-22">[22]</a>
      Chomsky demolishes the idea that natural language grammar can be
      modeled using only Markov chains. Instead, the paper advocates a
      natural language approach that uses three layers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Chomsky uses
        Markov's chains
        as his
        <b>bottom layer</b>.
        This becomes the modern compiler's
        <b>lexical phase</b>.</li>
      <li>Chomsky's
        <b>middle layer</b>
        uses context-free
        grammars and context-sensitive grammars.
        These are his own
        discoveries<a id="footnote-23-ref" href="#footnote-23">[23]</a>.
        This middle layer becomes the
        <b>syntactic phase</b>
        of modern
        compilers.</li>
      <li>Chomsky's
        <b>top layer</b>, again his own
        discovery, maps or
        <term>transforms</term>
        the output of the middle
        layer. Chomsky's top layer is the inspiration for AST transformation
        phase of modern compilers.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Term: <term>Parsing</term></h1>
    <p>Chomsky is a turning point, so much so that it establishes or settles the
      meaning of many of the terms we are using. <term>Parsing</term>,
      for our purposes, is transforming a string of symbols into a
      structure. Typically this structure is a parse tree.</p>
    <h1>Recognizers</h1>
    <p>In contrast to a parser,
      a
      <term>recognizer</term>
      is a program which takes a string and a grammar and answers
      <q>yes</q>
      or
      <q>no</q>
      --
      <q>yes</q>
      if the string is in the language described by the grammar,
      <q>no</q>
      otherwise.
      For a compiler to work, it clearly needs
      a parser, not a recognizer.
    </p><p>In comparing algorithms, it can be important to keep in mind
      whether they are recognizers or parsers.
      Recognizers can be,
      to some extent, pressed into service as parsers by introducing captures.
      This is often done, for example, with regular expressions,
      and if the semantics is very simple, it works.
    </p>
    <h1>1957: Kleene's regular expressions</h1>
    <p>Steven Kleene discovers regular expressions, a very handy notation
      for Markov chains. It will turn out that several other mathematical objects
      being studied at this time
      are also equivalent to regular expressions: the various
      finite state automata; and some of the objects being studied as
      neural nets.</p>
    <h1>1957: Chomsky publishes
      <cite>Syntactic Structures</cite></h1>
    <p>Noam Chomsky publishes
      <em>Syntactic Structures</em>, one of the most important books of
      all time. The orthodoxy in 1957 is structural linguistics which
      argues, with Sherlock Holmes, that
      <q>it is a capital mistake
        to theorize in advance of the facts</q>. Structuralists start
      with the utterances in a language, and build upward.</p>
    <p>But Chomsky claims that without a theory there are no facts: there
      is only noise. The Chomskyan approach is to start with a grammar,
      and use the corpus of the language to check its accuracy. Chomsky's
      approach will soon come to dominate linguistics.</p>
    <h1>Term: <term>Chomskyan parsing</term></h1>
    <p>In computing, parsing theory mainly follows Chomsky's work in
      linguistics. Parsing is <term>Chomksyan</term> if it is guided by
      a BNF grammar. From this point on, most parsers and most parsing
      theory will be Chomskyan; and this timeline will focus on Chomskyan
      parsing. But, as we shall see, non-Chomskyan parsing does survive
      and has its users today.</p>
    <h1>1957: FORTRAN released</h1>
    <p>Backus's team makes the first FORTRAN compiler available to IBM
      customers. FORTRAN is the first high-level language that will find
      widespread implementation. As of this writing, it is the oldest
      language that survives in practical use.</p>
    <p>FORTRAN is a line-by-line language and its parsing is pre-Chomskyan
      and ad hoc. But it includes one important discovery. FORTRAN I was
      line-by-line, but it allowed expressions. And, learning from the
      dissatisfaction with the compiler, FORTRAN honors associativity
      and precedence.</p>
    <p>The designers of FORTRAN discovered a strange trick --
      they hacked the expressions by adding parentheses around each
      operator. Surprisingly, this works. In fact, once the theoretical
      understanding of operator precedence comes about, the FORTRAN
      I implementation is actually a hackish and inefficient way of
      implementing precedence.</p>
    <h1>1958: LISP released</h1>
    <p>John McCarthy's LISP appears. LISP goes beyond the line-by-line
      syntax -- it is recursively structured. But the LISP interpreter does
      not find the recursive structure: the programmer must explicitly
      indicate the structure herself, using parentheses.
      Similarly, LISP does not have operator expressions in the usual sense --
      associativity and precedence must be specified with parentheses.
    </p>
    <h1>1959: Backus's notation</h1>
    <p>Backus discovers a new notation to describe the IAL language.
      (aka ALGOL)<a id="footnote-24-ref" href="#footnote-24">[24]</a>
    </p>
    <h1>1960: BNF</h1>
    <p>Peter Naur improves the Backus notation and uses it to describe
      ALGOL 60. The improved notation will become known as Backus-Naur Form
      (BNF).</p>
    <h1>1960: The ALGOL report</h1>
    <p>The ALGOL 60 report specifies, for the first time, a block
      structured language. ALGOL 60 is recursively structured but the
      structure is implicit -- newlines are not semantically significant,
      and parentheses indicate syntax only in a few specific cases. The
      ALGOL compiler will have to find the structure. It is a case of 1960's
      optimism at its best. As the ALGOL committee is well aware, a parsing
      algorithm capable of handling ALGOL 60 does not yet exist. But the
      risk they are taking will soon pay off.</p>
    <p>With the ALGOL 60 report, a quest begins which continues to this day: the search for a parser that is</p>
    <ul>
      <li>efficient,</li>
      <li>practical,</li>
      <li>declarative, and</li>
      <li>general.</li>
    </ul><p>
      On one hand, the
      risk they are taking will pay off immediately, producting vastly improved
      parsers and parsing theory.
      On the other hand, the parser they seek will not be discovered for
      three decades,
      two more decades will pass before it is
      implemented.
    </p>
    <h1>Term:
      <term>declarative</term></h1>
    <p>For our purposes, a parser is
      <term>declarative</term>,
      if it
      will parse directly and automatically from grammars written in BNF.
      Declarative parsers are often called
      <term>syntax-driven</term>
      parsers.
    </p>
    <h1>Term:
      <term>procedural</term></h1>
    <p>A parser is
      <term>procedural</term>, if it requires procedural
      logic as part of its syntax phase.
      If a parser is procedural, then it is not declarative.
    </p><h1>Term:
      <term>general</term></h1>
    <p>A general parser is a parser that will parse
      any grammar that can be written in BNF<a id="footnote-25-ref" href="#footnote-25">[25]</a>.
      This is a very useful property
      -- it makes it easy for a grammar-writer to know that her grammar
      will parse.
      This in turn
      makes it easy to auto-generate grammars,
      because it is easy for a program to know that
      the grammar it generates will successfully parse.
      This opens the way
      to true second-order languages -- languages which specify other
      languages.</p>
    <h1>1960: Gleenie's compiler-compiler</h1>
    <p>A.E. Gleenie publishes his description of a compiler-compiler<a id="footnote-26-ref" href="#footnote-26">[26]</a>.
      Glennie's
      <term>universal compiler</term>
      is more of a methodology
      than an implementation -- the compilers must be written by
      hand.
    </p><p>
      Glennie have been the first to use BNF as
      a description of a
      <em>procedure</em>
      instead of as the description of a
      <em>Chomsky grammar</em><a id="footnote-27-ref" href="#footnote-27">[27]</a>
      Glennie points out that the distinction is
      <q>important</q><a id="footnote-28-ref" href="#footnote-28">[28]</a>.
    </p>
    <p>BNF and Chomsky's context free grammars were created primarily as means
      of grammar
      <b>description</b>.
      It is for this reason that BNF is often used in standards and language
      manuals, where it is expected that the readers of the BNF will be people
      not machines.
      Given a BNF notation,
      a human can very reasonably determine exactly what strings are and
      are not in a language, and the structure of the parses of those
      strings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, a notation exact enough to determine what string are and
      are not in a language,
      and their parses,
      and which does so in a way accessible to human readers,
      could drive a computer algorithm.
      At least so you would hope and expect.

      As this timeline will show, a practical declarative
      parser proved elusive.
      BNF remained an attractive notation, and in the place of
      declarative parsers, there arose, beginning with Glennie,
      parsers which are driven by BNF notation, but which do
      not parse the language described by that notation.
    </p>
    <p>
      BNF
      notation, when used to describe a procedure, is a set of instructions,
      to be tried in some order, and used to process a string. Procedural
      BNF describes a procedure first, and a language only indirectly.</p>
    <p>
      I will call these
      <term>pseudo-declarative</term>
      parsers.
      To be sure, Glennie in
      <a href="#bib-Glennie_1960">Glennie 1960</a>never pretends this parser is declarative.
      Glennie points the distinction out carefully,
      and notes that it is
      <q>important</q><a id="footnote-29-ref" href="#footnote-29">[29]</a>.
      But many subsequent writers will be less clear on the matter,
      and many more of the readers will suffer because of it.
      Many will waste time assuming that they can get eventually their test
      suite to write by writing BNF which describes it.
      Others will get their test suite to work,
      and will think (falsely)
      that this means that the language their parser parses is that
      specified by the BNF.
    </p><p>Both procedural and Chomskyan BNF describe languages, but usually
      <em>not the same</em>
      language. This is an important point, and one which will be
      overlooked many times in the years to come.</p>
    <p>[TODO: needs revision. ]
      The pre-Chomskyan approach, using procedural BNF, is far more
      natural to someone trained as a computer programmer. The parsing
      problem appears to the programmer in the form of strings to be
      parsed, exactly the starting point of procedural BNF and pre-Chomsky
      parsing.</p>
    <p>Even when the Chomskyan approach is pointed out, it does not
      at first seem very attractive. With the pre-Chomskyan approach,
      the examples of the language more or less naturally lead to a
      parser. In the Chomskyan approach the programmer has to search for
      an algorithm to parse strings according to his grammar -- and the
      search for good algorithms to parse Chomskyan grammars has proved
      surprisingly long and difficult. Handling semantics is more natural
      with a Chomksyan approach. But, using captures, semantics can be
      added to a pre-Chomskyan parser and, with practice, this seems
      natural enough.</p>
    <p>Despite the naturalness of the pre-Chomskyan approach to parsing,
      we will find that the first fully-described automated parsers
      are Chomskyan. This is a testimony to Chomsky's influence at the
      time. We will also see that Chomskyan parsers have been dominant
      ever since.</p>
    <h1>1960: Operator precedence and stacks</h1>
    <p>Since FORTRAN I, many people have refined its operator precedence implementation.
      A Feb 1960 paper by Samuelson and Bauer<a id="footnote-30-ref" href="#footnote-30">[30]</a>
      describes in detail the use of stacks to implement
      operator precedence.
      This paper was very influential.
    </p>
    <h1>1961: The first parsing paper</h1>
    <p>In January, Ned Irons publishes a paper describing his ALGOL
      60 parser. It is the first paper to fully describe any parser. The
      Irons algorithm is Chomskyan and top-down with a bottom-up <term>left
      corner</term> element -- it is what now would be called a <term>left
      corner</term> parser.<a id="footnote-31-ref" href="#footnote-31">[31]</a>
    </p>
    <p>You would expect parsing might start with hard-written
      parsers for specific grammar classes.
      But in fact, this first parser is declarative and general.
      And since it is general,
      operator expressions are well within the power of
      <a href="#bib-Irons_1961">Irons 1961</a>.
    </p>
    <h1>Terms:
      <term>Top-down</term></h1>
    <p>A top-down parser deduces the consituents of a rule from the rule.
      That is, it looks at the rule first,
      and then deduces what is on its RHS.
      Thus, it works from start rule, and works
      <q>top down</q>
      until it arrives at the input tokens.
    </p>
    <p>It is important to note that no useful parser can be purely top-down --
      if parser worked purely pure top-down, it would never look at its input.
      So every top-parser we will consider has *some* kind of bottom-up element.
      That bottom-up element may be very simple -- for example, one character lookahead.
      The
      <a href="#bib-Irons_1961">Irons 1961</a>
      parser,
      like most modern top-down parsers,
      has a sophisticated bottom-up element.
    </p>
    <h1>Terms:
      <term>Bottom-up</term></h1>
    <p>A bottom-up parser deduces a rule from its constituents.
      That is, it looks at either the input or the LHS symbols
      of previously deduced rules,
      and from that deduces a rule.
      Thus, it works from the input tokens, and works
      <q>bottom up</q>
      until it reaches the start rule.
    </p>
    <p>Many programmers have a fixation on classifying parsers in terms
      of top-down and bottom-up.
      As we saw, the
      <a href="#bib-Irons_1961">Irons 1961</a>
      parser is not simply top-down or
      bottom-up, though arguably describing it in terms of top-down and
      bottom-up components is helpful. But for other parsing algorithms,
      top-down vs. bottom-up classification is a pointless pedantry --
      the classification can be done, but tells you nothing about the
      actual behavior of the parser.</p>
    <h1>Terms: <term>Synthetic attribute</term></h1>
    <p><a href="#bib-Irons_1961">Irons 1961</a>
      also introduces synthetic attributes: the parse creates
      a tree, which is evaluated bottom-up. Each node is evaluated using
      attributes <q>synthesized</q> from its child nodes.<a id="footnote-32-ref" href="#footnote-32">[32]</a>
    </p>
    <p>Synthetic attributes are a concept in semantics, not parsing,
      but they will be important for us.
      Almost everyone doing practical parsing does so because
      she intends to move on to a semantics phase, and
      feedback from new
      semantic concepts often has major effects on the development of
      parsing.</p>
    <h1>1961: Lucas discovers recursive descent</h1>
    <p>Peter Lucas publishes the first description of a purely top-down parser<a id="footnote-33-ref" href="#footnote-33">[33]</a>.
      Either Irons paper or this one can be considered to be recursive descent<a id="footnote-34-ref" href="#footnote-34">[34]</a>.
      Certainly the Lucas algorithm more closely resembles modern implementations of recursive descent.</p>
    <p>Except to say that he deals properly with them, Lucas does not say
      how he parses operator expressions. But it is easy to believe Lucas'
      claim -- by this time there are several specialized techniques for
      parsing operator expressions and Lucas cites
      <a href="#bib-Samuelson_and_Bauer_1960">Samuelson and Bauer 1960</a>.
    </p>
    <p>For our purposes, it is sufficient to note that while recursive
      descent cannot parse arithmetic expressions directly, it can deal
      with them in two ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Recursive descent can switch to another algorithm when
          it encounters an operator expression. This is easy to do in a
          hand-written implementation.</p></li>
      <li><p>It can parse the operands and operands into a list, and
          the list can be reparsed in post-processing. This is essentially
          a delayed-action form of the first method.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>[ TODO -- Rewrite. ]
      Lucas' writeup most likely describes a hand-written
      parser, not a declarative one.
      In the 1960s,
      Hand-coded approaches became more popular than declarative
      approaches like that of Irons due to three factors:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Memory and CPU were both extremely limited. Hand-coding
          paid off, even when the gains were small.</p></li>
      <li><p>Top-down parsing is intuitive -- it essentially means
          calling subroutines. It therefore requires little or no knowledge of
          parsing theory. This makes it a good fit for hand-coding.</p></li>
      <li><p>Pure recursive descent is, in fact, a very weak parsing
          technique. Pure recursive descent cannot
          deal with either of the operator grammars we have described:
          <a href="g-basic">basic</a>
          or
          <a href="g-right-recursive">right-recursive</a>.
          Recursive descent has severe limits,
          it is often necessary to go beyond them,
          and that helps justify
          coding the entire parser by hand.</p>

    <h1>1961: Dijkstra's shunting yard algorithm</h1>
    <p>In November 1961, Dijkstra publishes the <q>shunting yard</q> algorithm.<a id="footnote-35-ref" href="#footnote-35">[35]</a>
      <a
href="https://www.engr.mun.ca/~theo/Misc/exp_parsing.htm">Theodore
        Norvell has made an attempt at classification</a>
      of the botanical profusion of operator expression parsers. All
      earlier parsers are subspecies of what he calls <q>the classic

      of level of precedence is not <q>built in</q> into the
      shunting-yard algorithm. And the shunting-yard algorithm is more
      efficient than the classic approaches: Code size does not grow,
      and the algorithm's speed does not decrease, with the number of
      precedence levels. Dijkstra's algorithm is not a game-changer --
      it has no major impact on the Operator Issue -- but it offers a
      genuinely different implementation alternative.</p>
    <h1>The operator issue as of 1961</h1>
    <p>Originally the operator issue was that it required a parsing
      algorithm at a time
      when there were no parsing algorithms.
      With Lucas paper, the operator issue takes a new form --
      one which it still has over 50 years later.
      Specifically, recursive descent cannot parse this very simple operator grammar:
    </p id="g-basic"><ul>
      <li>S ::= E</li>
      <li>E ::= E + T</li>
      <li>E ::= T</li>
      <li>T ::= T * F</li>
      <li>T ::= F</li>
      <li>F ::= number</li>
    </ul><p>
      In fact recursive descent cannot parse any left recursive grammar.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the problem is even more severe than that.
      For human readers, left association is natural for most operators,
      and they would find reversing it to be very confusing.
      But suppose we ignore that face and rewrite the above grammar to be right
      recursive:
    </p id="g-right_recursive"><ul>
      <li>S ::= E</li>
      <li>E ::= T + E</li>
      <li>E ::= T</li>
      <li>T ::= F * T</li>
      <li>T ::= F</li>
      <li>F ::= number</li>
    </ul><p>
      Recursive descent cannot parse this grammar either --
      the lookahead required is just too much for it.
    </p><p>This means that by itself, recursive descent is never
      sufficient for practical grammars -- it must always be part of a
      hybrid.

    <h1>Term: "linear time"</h1>
    <p>[ TODO.  And where to put this? After Knuth 1965?]
    </p>
    <h1>Misconception: deterministic parsing versus deterministic parsers</h1>
    <p>Knuth in his 1965 investigates the question:
      "What is the best a deterministic parser can do?".
      Many people mistook this as answering a similar-sounding but
      different question:
      "What is the best way to parse a deterministic grammar?".
    </p>
    <p>More precisely, Knuth found the largest class of grammars that
      a deterministic parser could parse in linear time,
      and found an algorithm to do it.
      (It's called LR(k).)
      Many people took that to be the answer to the question:
      "Which deterministic grammars can be parsed in linear time,
      and what is the best algorithm for that."
      It seems reasonable to guess the two questions are essentially
      the same,
      and have the same answer.
      In fact, most people as the time, and since,
      have taken that guess as a fact.
      But as we will see,
      in 1991 that guess turns out to be wrong.
    </p><h1>1968: Lewis and Stearns discover LL</h1>
    <p>When Knuth discovered the LR grammars, he announced them to
      the world with a full-blown mathematical description. The top-down
      grammars, which arose historically, lack such a description. In 1968,
      Lewis and Stearns fill that gap by defining the LL(k) grammars<a id="footnote-39-ref" href="#footnote-39">[39]</a>.
    </p>
    <h1>Terms:
      <term>LL</term>,
      <term>LR</term>,

      and
      <term>RR</term></h1>
    <p>When LL is added to the vocabulary of parsing, the meaning of
      <term>LR</term>
      shifts slightly. In 1965 Knuth meant LR to mean
      <q>translatable from left to right</q><a id="footnote-40-ref" href="#footnote-40">[40]</a>.
      LL means
      <q>scan from the left, using left reductions</q>
      and LR acquires its current meaning of
      <q>scan from the left, using
        right reductions</q><a id="footnote-41-ref" href="#footnote-41">[41]</a>.
    </p><p>If there is a number after the parentheses in this notation for
      parsing algorithms, it usually indicates the number of tokens of
      lookahead.
      As an example, LL(1) --
      <q>scan from the
        left, using left reductions with one character of lookahead</q>
      --
      will be important in what follows.

    <h1>LL(1) and the Operator Issue</h1>
    <p>
      With
      <a href="#bib-Knuth_1965">Knuth 1965</a>
      and
      <a href="#bib-Lewis_and_Stearns_1968">Lewis and Stearns 1968</a>,
      a precise terminology falls into place for describing
      the
      <q>Operator Issue</q>.
      [ TODO: Go back to Operator Issue terminology? ]
      We can state what the problem has been with recursive descent.
      Recursive Descent, in its pure form, is LL(1).
      Arithmetic operator grammars are not LL(1) -- no even close.
      In fact neither
      the
      <a href="#g-basic">Basic Operator Grammar</a>
      or its
      <a href="#right-recursive">right recursive variant</a>
      is LL(k) for any k.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something has to give as long as you
      are using recursive descent. And this is a major reason why truly
      declarative versions of LL(1) are not used. A pure declarative
      LL(1) parser generator
      <em>could</em>
      be written, but it would not be able to parse arithmetic expressions
      properly.</p>

      Like the Irons
      algorithm, Earley's algorithm is Chomskyan, declarative and fully
      general. Unlike the Irons algorithm, it does not backtrack. Earley's
      algorithm is both top-down and bottom-up at once -- it uses dynamic
      programming and keeps track of the parse in tables. Earley's approach
      makes a lot of sense and looks very promising indeed, but there are
      three serious issues:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>First, there is a bug in the handling of zero-length rules.</li>
      <li>Second, it is quadratic for right recursions.</li>
      <li>Third, the bookkeeping required to set up the tables is,
        by the standards of 1968 hardware, daunting.</li>

    <h1>1968: Attribute grammars</h1>
    <p>Knuth publishes a paper on a concept he had been working for the
      previous few years: attribute grammars<a id="footnote-43-ref" href="#footnote-43">[43]</a>
      Irons' synthetic attributes had always been inadequate for many
      problems, and had been supplemented by side effects or state
      variables. Knuth adds inherited attributes, and discovers attribute
      grammars.</p>
    <h1>Term:
      <term>Inherited attributes</term></h1>
    <p>Recall that a node in parse gets its synthetic attributes from
      its parents. Inherited attributes are attibutes a node gets from
      its parents. Of course, this creates potential circularities, but
      inherited attributes are powerful and, with care, the circularities
      can be dealt with.</p>

    <p>An attribute grammar is a grammar whose node may have both inherited and synthetic attributes.</p>
    <h1>1969: LALR</h1>
    <p>Frank DeRemer describes a new variant of Knuth's LR

      of
      their two volume textbook
      summarizing the theory of parsing.
      This book is still important. It
      is also distressingly up-to-date -- progress in parsing theory
      slowed dramatically after 1972. Aho and Ullman's version
      of Earley's algorithm includes
      a straightforward fix to the zero-length rule bug in Earley's
      original<a id="footnote-45-ref" href="#footnote-45">[45]</a>.
      Unfortunately, this fix involves adding even
      more bookkeeping to Earley's.</p>
    <p>Under the names TDPL and GTDPL, Aho and Ullman investigate
      the non-Chomksyan parsers in the Schorre lineage<a id="footnote-46-ref" href="#footnote-46">[46]</a>. They note that
      <q>it can be quite difficult to determine what language is
        defined by a TDPL parser<q><a id="footnote-47-ref" href="#footnote-47">[47]</a>.
          That is, GTDPL parsers do whatever
          they do, and that whatever is something the programmer in general
          will not be able to describe. The best a programmer can usually
          do is to create a test suite and fiddle with the GTDPL description
          until it passes. Correctness cannot be established in any stronger
          sense. GTDPL is an extreme form of the old joke that
          <q>the code is
            the documentation</q>
          -- with GTDPL nothing documents the language
          of the parser, not even the code.</q></q></p>
    <p>GTDPL's obscurity buys nothing in the way of additional parsing
      power. Like all non-Chomskyan parsers, GTDPL is basically a extremely
      powerful recognizer. Pressed into service as a parser, it is
      comparatively weak. As a parser, GTDPL is essentially equivalent to
      Lucas's 1961 algorithm, which was in turn a restricted
      form of recursive descent.</p>
    <p>At or around this time, rumor has it that the main line of
      development for GTDPL parsers is classified secret by the US
      government<a id="footnote-48-ref" href="#footnote-48">[48]</a>.
      GTDPL parsers have the property that even small changes in
      GTDPL parsers can be very labor-intensive. For some government
      contractors, GTDPL parsing provides steady work for years to
      come. Public interest in GTDPL fades.</p>
    <h1>1973: Pratt parsing</h1>
    <p>One approach to the Operator Issue has not been mentioned. We
      have noted that LL(1) cannot parse operator expressions. What about
      making the entire grammar an operator grammar? That way you don't
      have to mix algorithms.</p>
    <p>It's an idea that had already occurred to
      Samuelson and Bauer in 1960.
      They intended their operator parser as a parser for ALGOL.
    </p><p>There are many problems with switching to operator
      grammars. Operator grammar are non-Chomskyan -- the BNF no longer
      accurately describes the grammar<a id="footnote-49-ref" href="#footnote-49">[49]</a>. Instead the BNF becomes part of
      a combined notation, and the actual grammar parsed depends also on
      precedence and semantics.
      And operator grammars have a very restricted
      form -- most practical languages are not operator grammars.</p>
    <p>But many practical grammars are almost operator grammars. And the
      Chomskyan approach has always had its dissenters.

      of these, and discovered a new approach (the third and last in

    href="https://www.engr.mun.ca/~theo/Misc/exp_parsing.htm">Theodore
        Norvell's taxonomy</a>) to operator expression parsing, one which
      some have adopted as an overall solution to their parsing problems<a id="footnote-50-ref" href="#footnote-50">[50]</a>.
    </p>
    <p>The Pratt approach, and its descendant, precedence climbing,
      is not popular as an overall strategy.
      It is most often used as an alternative to the classic
      and the shunting yard approached,
      within a recursive descent strategy.
      All
      operator expression subparsers break the Chomskyan paradigm so the
      non-Chomskyan nature of Pratt's parser is not a problem in this
      context. But with respect to the Operator Issue, like Dijkstra's
      alternative, it is an implementation choice, not a game-changer.</p>

      writing toolkit yet developed.</p>
    <p>Part of the V7 toolkit is Yet Another Compiler Compiler
      (YACC)<a id="footnote-54-ref" href="#footnote-54">[54]</a>. YACC is LALR-powered. Despite its name, YACC is the first
      compiler-compiler in the modern sense. For some useful languages, the
      process of going from Chomskyan specification to executable is fully
      automated. Most practical languages, including the C language and
      YACC's own input language, still require manual hackery. Nonetheless,
      after two decades of research, it seems that the parsing problem
      is solved.</p>

    <h1>1990: Monads</h1>
    <p>
      Wadler starts to introduce monads to the functional programming community.
      As one example he converts his previous efforts at function parsing
      techniques<a id="footnote-56-ref" href="#footnote-56">[56]</a>.
      The parsing technique is pure recursive descent.
      The examples shown for monadic parsing are very simple,
      and do not include operator expressions.
      In his earlier non-monadic work, Wadler uses a very restricted form of operator expression:
      His grammar avoided left recursion by using parentheses,
      and operator precedence was not implemented<a id="footnote-57-ref" href="#footnote-57">[57]</a>.
    </p>
    <h1>1991: Leo's speed-up of Earley's algorithm</h1>
    <p>Joop Leo discovers a way of speeding up right recursions in
      Earley's algorithm<a id="footnote-58-ref" href="#footnote-58">[58]</a>. Leo's algorithm is linear for just about every
      unambiguous grammar of practical interest, and many ambiguous ones
      as well. In 1991 hardware is six orders of magnitude faster than
      1968 hardware, so that the issue of bookkeeping overhead had receded
      in importance. This is a major discovery. When it comes to speed,
      the game has changed in favor of the Earley algorithm.</p>
    <p>But Earley parsing is almost forgotten. Twenty years will
      pass before anyone writes a practical implementation of Leo's
      algorithm.</p>
    <h1>The 1990's</h1>
    <p>Earley's is forgotten. So everyone in LALR-land is content,
      right? Wrong. Far from it, in fact. Users of LALR are making
      unpleasant discoveries. While LALR automatically generates their
      parsers, debugging them is so hard they could just as easily write the
      parser by hand. Once debugged, their LALR parsers are fast for correct
      inputs. But almost all they tell the users about incorrect inputs
      is that they are incorrect. In Larry's words, LALR is
      <q>fast
        but stupid</q><a id="footnote-59-ref" href="#footnote-59">[59]</a>.
    </p>
    <h1>1992: Combinator parsing</h1>
    <p>Combinators are parsers which can be
      <q>combined</q>
      to compose other parsers.
      This allows you to have an algebra of parsers.
      It's an extremely attractive idea,
      and suggestive of great power,
      but in fact underneath it is nothing but recursive descent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Combinator parsing
      was introduced in two 1992 papers<a id="footnote-60-ref" href="#footnote-60">[60]</a>.
      Of more interest
      to us is the one by Hutton, which focuses on combinator parsing<a id="footnote-61-ref" href="#footnote-61">[61]</a>.
      Combinators will become important in programming languages and
      semantics. But in terms of parsing algorithms, Hutton introduces
      nothing new -- wrapped up in an attribute grammar; underlying the
      exciting new mathematics is the decades-old recursive descent,
      unchanged.
    </p><p>Hutton's example language is very basic --
      his expressions require left association,
      but not precedence.
      Left association is implemented by post-processing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hutton's main presentation does not use monads.
      In his final pages, however,
      Hutton points out
      <q>combinator parsers give rise to a monad</q>
      and shows
      how his presentation could be rewritten in a form
      closely related to monads<a id="footnote-62-ref" href="#footnote-62">[62]</a>.
    </p>
    <h1>1995: Wadler's monads</h1><p>
      Today monads are a hot topic.
      In their adaptation into the world of
      programming,
      the 1995 article by Wadler
      <a id="footnote-63-ref" href="#footnote-63">[63]</a>
      is a turning point.
      One of Wadler's examples is a parser based on
      monads and combinator parsing.
      From here on out,
      an combinator parsing will become the standard
      example of monad programming.
    </p>
    <p>In its monadic form,
      the already attractive technique of combinator parsing is extremely elegant
      and certainly seems as if it *should* solve all parsing problems.
      But, once again, it is still recursive descent.
      Wadler handles left recursion by rewriting into
      right recursive list, and re-processing the list
      into left recursive form.
      Wadler's example grammar only has one operator,
      so the issue of precedence does not arise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of one paradigm to solve them all,
      Wadler ends up with a two layered approach,
      with a hackish bottom layer and an awkward interface.
      This undercuts
      the simplicity and elegance of the combinator approach.
    </p>
    <h1>1996: Hutton and Meijer on cominator parsing</h1><p>
      <comment>TODO: Expand with stuff on operator issue</comment>
      Wadler had used parsing as an example to motivate
      his presentation of monads.
      In 1996, Graham Hutton and Erik Meijer<a id="footnote-64-ref" href="#footnote-64">[64]</a>
      take the opposite perspective -- they
      write a paper on combinator parsing that could
      <q>also be viewed as a first introduction to the use
        of monads in programming.</q><a id="footnote-65-ref" href="#footnote-65">[65]</a>

    </p><h1>The Operator Issue as of 1999</h1>
    <p>
      As we have seen,
      the contributions of combinators parsing,
      and monads to parsing theory itself are minimal.
      But effect on
      interfaces and the way parsing is seen is large
      and likely to grow.
      And following this literature has allowed us to
      see what is consider the state of the parsing art
      at the time.
    </p>
    <h1>2000: The Perl 6 effort begins</h1>

    <h1>2002: Aycock and Horspool solve Earley's zero-length rule problem</h1>
    <p>John Aycock and R. Nigel Horspool publish their attempt at a
      fast, practical Earley's parser<a id="footnote-67-ref" href="#footnote-67">[67]</a>. Missing from it is Joop Leo's
      improvement -- they seem not to be aware of it. Their own speedup
      is limited in what it achieves and the complications it introduces
      can be counter-productive at evaluation time. But buried in their
      paper is a solution to the zero-length rule bug. And this time the
      solution requires no additional bookkeeping.</p>
    <h1>2004: PEG</h1>
    <p>Ford<a id="footnote-68-ref" href="#footnote-68">[68]</a>fills this gap by
      repackaging the nearly-forgotten GTDPL. Ford adds packratting,
      so that PEG is always linear, and provides PEG with an attractive
      new syntax.</p>
    <p>Implementers by now are avoiding YACC, but the demand for
      declarative parsers remains. PEG is not, in fact, declarative,
      but it uses the same BNF notation, and many users don't know the
      difference. And nothing has been done to change
      <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.io/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/individual/2015/03/peg.html">the problematic behaviors</a>
      of GTDPL.</p>
    <h1>2006: GNU C reverts to recursive descent</h1>
    <p>
      <q>The old Bison-based C and Objective-C parser has been replaced by a new, faster hand-written recursive-descent
        parser.<q><a id="footnote-69-ref" href="#footnote-69">[69]</a>
          Bison, an LALR parser, is the direct descendant of Steve Johnson's YACC.
        </q></q></p>
    <p>
      With this single line in middle of a change list hundreds of lines long.
      GNU announces a major event in parsing history.
      For three decades, the industry's flagship C compilers have
      used LALR as their parser -- proof of the claim that LALR and serious
      parsing are equivalent.
      Now, GNU replaces LALR with the technology
      that it replaced a quarter century earlier: recursive descent.</p>
    <h1>2010: Leo 1991 is implemented</h1><p>
    </p><p>Jeffrey Kegler (the author of this timeline) releases the first
      practical implementation of Joop Leo's algorithm<a id="footnote-70-ref" href="#footnote-70">[70]</a>.
      The new parser, named Marpa, is general, declarative
      and linear for all the grammars discussed in
      <a href="#bib-Knuth_1965">Knuth 1965</a>, that is, it is
      linear for the LR(k) grammars for all finite k<a id="footnote-71-ref" href="#footnote-71">[71]</a>
      This means it is also linear for most of the grammar classes we have discussed in this
      timeline.
    </p><ul>
      <li>LR(1) grammars.</li>
      <li>LL(k) grammars for all finite k, including LL(1) grammars.</li>
      <li>Operator expression grammars<a id="footnote-72-ref" href="#footnote-72">[72]</a>.
        <a href="#bib-Leo_1991">Leo 1991</a>
        does not address the zero-length
        rule problem.
        Kegler solves it by adopting the solution of
        <a href="#bib-Aycock_and_Horspool_2002">Aycock and Horspool 2002</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is a vast class of grammars,
      and it has the important feature that a programmer
      (and, for the benefit of automatic grammar generation,
      a program)
      can readily determine if their grammar is linear under Marpa.
      Marpa will parse a grammar in linear time, if
    </p><ul id="loc-linearity-rules">
      <li>It is unambiguous.<a id="footnote-73-ref" href="#footnote-73">[73]</a>
      </li>
      <li>It has no unmarked middle recursions<a id="footnote-74-ref" href="#footnote-74">[74]</a>.
      </li>
      <li>It has no ambiguous right recursions<a id="footnote-75-ref" href="#footnote-75">[75]</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Finally in an effort to combine the best of declarative and hand-written parsing,
      Kegler reorders Earley's parse engine so that it
      allows procedural logic.
      As a side effect,
      this gives Marpa excellent error-handling properties.

    <h1>2012: General precedence parsing</h1>
    <p>
      While the purely
      precedence-driven parsing of
      <a href="#bib-Samuelson_and_Bauer_1960">Samuelson and Bauer 1960</a>
      and
      <a href="#bib-Pratt_1973">Pratt 1973</a>
      never caught on,
      the use of precedence in parsing remains popular.
      In fact, precedence tables often occur in documentation
      and standards,
      which is a clear sign that they too can contribute
      to human-readable but precise descriptions of grammars.
    </p>
    <p>
      <comment>TODO: Finish</comment>
      In 2012, Kegler release a version of Marpa which allows
      the user to mix Chomskyan and precedence parsing at will<a id="footnote-76-ref" href="#footnote-76">[76]</a>.
      Marpa's
      <q>precedenced statements</q>
      describe expressions
      in terms of precedence and association, but they strictly
      translate into Chomskyan form,
      so a user writing a precedenced statement
      does not lose the benefits
      of Chomskyan parsing.
      If
      <q>precedenced statements</q>
      are added to a grammar that Marpa parses in linear
      time, then the grammar remains linear as long as the precedenced statements
      are (after precedence is taken in consideration) unambiguous<a id="footnote-77-ref" href="#footnote-77">[77]</a>.

        The formal apparatus for describing operator expressions is not fully formed
        as of 1949 and,
        in any case,
        a very formal definition is beyond the scope of this timeline.

          This timeline refers to precedence levels as

          or
          <q>loose</q>.
          The traditional terminology is confusing: tighter
          precedences are
          <q>higher</q>
          but traditionally the
          precendence levels are also numbered and the higher
          the number, the lower the precedence.

        I hope nobody will interpret this terminological clarification as in any sense
        detracting from Hopper's achievement.
        Whatever it is called, Hopper's program was a major advance,
        both in terms of insight and execution, and her energetic followup
        did much to move forward the events in this timeline.
        Hopper has a big reputation and it is fully deserved

        As a pedantic point, a general parser need only parse
        <term>proper</term>
        grammars. A BNF grammar is
        <term>proper</term>
        if it has no useless rules and no infinite loops.
        Neither of these
        have any practical use, so that the restriction to proper grammars
        is unproblematic.

        I follow
        <a href="#bib-Grune_and_Jacobs_2008">Grune and Jacobs 2008</a>
        in calling Lucas the discoverer of recursive descent.
        In fact, both
        <a href="#bib-Irons_1961">Irons 1961</a>
        and
        <a href="#bib-Lucas_1961">Lucas 1961</a>
        are recursive descent with a major bottom-up element.
        In conversation, Irons often described his 1961 parser as a kind of recursive descent.
        Perhaps Grune and Jacobs based their decision on the Lucas' description of his algorithm,
        which talks about his parser's bottom-up element only briefly,
        while describing the top-down element in detail.
        Also, the Lucas algorithm more resembles modern implementations of recursive descent
        much more closely than

 <a href="#footnote-33-ref">&#8617;</a></p>
<p id="footnote-34">34.
        As a former student of Irons at Yale,
        my personal preference would be to give Ned the credit
        for recursive descent.
        And this is what Peter Denning does in his introduction
        to the reprint of
        <a href="#bib-Irons_1961">Irons 1961</a>
        (<cite>Communications of the ACM</cite>, 25th Anniversary Issue, p. 14).

        LL and LR have mirror images: RL means

        of
        <q>scan from the right, using right reductions</q>.
        Practical use of these
        mirror images is rare, but it may have occurred
        in one of the algorithms in our timeline
        --
        operator expression parsing

        that focuses on implementation issues.
        Some of his grammars include operator expressions,
        but these avoid left recursion,
        and implement precedence and associativity,
        using parentheses.

        In fact,
        <a href="#bib-Leo_1991">Leo 1991</a>
        proves his algorithm is linear for the LR-regular
        grammars -- the LR grammars with infinite lookahead, so long as the lookahead
        is a regular expresion.
        It is not known (in fact not decidable, see
        <a href="#bib-Leo_1991">Leo 1991</a>, p. 175.),
        just how large a class of grammars
        Marpa is linear for.
        But it is known that there are both ambiguous and unambiguous grammars
        for which Marpa is not linear.
        In the general case, Marpa obeys the bounds of Earley's algorithm --
        it is worst-case O(n**2) for unambiguous grammars;
        and worst-case O(n**3) for ambiguous grammars.
        On the other hand, Marpa follows
        <a href="#bib-Leo_1991">Leo 1991</a>
        in being linear for many ambiguous grammars,
        including those of most practical interest.

          In the literature operator expression grammars are more often
          call simply
          <q>operator grammars</q>.

          In the general case, ambiguity is undecidable, but
          in practice it is usually straight-forward for a programmer
          to determine that the grammar he wants is unambiguous.
          Note the while the general case is undecidable,
          Marpa will tell the programmer is a parse (a grammar with a
          particular input) is ambiguous and, since it parses ambiguous
          grammars, produces an error message showing where the ambiguity is.

A
          <q>marker</q>, in this sense, is something in the input
          that shows where the middle of a middle recursion is,
          without having to go to the end and count back.
          Whether or not a grammar is unmarked is, in general,
          an undecidable problem.
          But in practice, there's a easy rule:
          if a person can
          <q>eyeball</q>
          the moddie of a long
          middle recursion, and does not need to count from both
          ends to find it,
          the grammar is
          <q>marked</q>.

          This is a very pedantic requirement,
          which practical programmers can in fact ignore.
          It is an open question whether there
          <em>are</em>
          any unambiguous
          grammars with ambiguous right recursions.
          In any case, in practice, a programmer,
          in determining that his grammar is ambiguity-free
          will spot any unambiguous right recursions as well.

        Internally, Marpa rewrites precedenced statements into BNF.
        Marpa's rewrite does not use middle recursions
        and does not introduce any new ambiguities
        so that, following its
        <a href="#loc-linearity-rules">linearity
          rules</a>, the result must be linear.

        In this, precedence goes from tightest to loosest.
        Single bars (<tt>|</tt>) separate RHS's of equal precedence.
        Double bars (<tt>||</tt>) separate RHS's of different precedence --
        precedence goes from tightest to loosest.
        Associativity default to left,
        and exceptions are indicated by the value of the
        <tt>assoc</tt>
        adverb.
        Note that these
        <q>precedenced statements</q>,
        like all of Marpa's DSL,
        are parsed by Marpa itself.
        The form shown has the semantic adverbs removed for clarity.
