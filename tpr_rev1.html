    <h1>Revisions to "Perl and Undecidability", Part 1, TPR Spring 2008</h1>
    <h2>Running Perl Versus Analyzing It</h2>
    <p>bryan d foy  (the TPR editor) and I hacked on the first paragraph
      of this article right up to the deadline, and I'm not 100% happy with
      one aspect of the result. You could read the first paragraph to imply
      there is one way you can always figure out what Perl code is going
      to do:
      Simply run it and see what happens. As the series goes on to
      make clear, that is false.
      It's false because Perl doesn't necessarily
      halt, either in the parse phase or the run phase.
      And because you
      can't solve the Halting Problem, you also can't analyze Perl to
      decide if it will halt.
    </p>
    <p>If a Perl program is taking a very
      long time, in the general case there is no way you can know whether
      it will ever finish.
      So running a Perl program does not tell you
      what a program will do, just what it has done done so far.
      This is
      not just a theoretical quibble.
      Not knowing when and if you'll ever
      get your answer is a huge obstacle in practice.
    </p>
    <p>In practice,
      static analysis of Perl is a very different beast from running the
      program.
      But from the point of view of theoretically impossible or
      possible, there is no hard and fast difference between analyzing
      code and running it.
      If you think about it, you'll realize that as
      you analyze code more and more, you reach the point where you're
      simulating the code, and execution of code is execution of code,
      whether you are simulating or not.
      Everything which is impossible to
      discover by running code is impossible to discover by analyzing code
      and vice versa.
    </p>
    <h2>Turing did not Formulate the Halting Problem</h2>
    <p>On page 25, column 1, paragraph 2, the article states what had
      been repeated even by the most authoritative sources for years:
      that Alan Turing formulated the Halting Problem.
      It's become
      clear since this article came out that Turing did not formulate
      the Halting problem.
      Jack Copeland seems to be responsible for
      pointing this out (see his <cite>The Essential Turing</cite>,
      Oxford 2004,
      p. 40).
      According to Copeland, Martin Davis was probably the
      first person to restate Turing's results as the Halting Problem.
    </p>
    <p>Before Copeland, it was standard even for scholarly sources
      to misattribute the Halting Problem to Turing.
      (As one example,
      see John Stillwell's highly praised <cite>Mathematics and Its History</cite>,
      Second Edition. Springer 2002, p. 469.)
      This is one case of a
      general problem -- mathematicians are surprisingly poor historians.
      It's not at all unusual to find a book which presents the math with
      excruciating care for two hundred pages, but which in its "historical"
      section trades largely in hearsay and rumor.
    </p>
    <p>This makes
      things very dangerous for those of us writing about math.  Now, I've
      never even seen Cantor's original paper with his Diagonal Proof, not
      even in translation.
      But I feel entitled to attribute it to him,
      relying on the fact that the Diagonal Proof has repeatedly been
      attributed to Cantor by any number of highly expert mathematical
      writers.
      Unfortunately, given the current state of affairs in
      mathematical history, it would not surprise me in the least to
      discover some day the Diagonal Proof is not, in fact, Cantor's.

    <h2>Typos</h2>
    <p><b>Page 23, column 1, the first line in the text</b>:  "If" should be "if".
    </p>
    <p><b>Page 25, column 2, last sentence in the first paragraph of the "About the Author" section</b>:
    "the author the of" should be "the author of".
