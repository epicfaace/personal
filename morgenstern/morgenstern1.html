    <h1>G&ouml;del and the Constitution I: The Fatal Contradiction</h1>
    <div style="text-align:center">by Jeffrey Kegler</div>
    <p>On 5 December 1947, Kurt G&ouml;del, the man <i>Time</i> magazine called the last century's greatest mathematician, had his citizenship hearing. One of G&ouml;del's witnesses was the man the same issue of <i>Time</i> called the century's greatest person, Albert Einstein. The other witness was Oskar Morgenstern, co-inventor of game theory.</p>
    <p>At the hearing, the prospective citizen has to answer a few basic questions. Not a big deal, you'd think, for the second greatest mind in the world, especially when he's got number one there to vouch for him. But G&ouml;del, for better and for worse, was not like other people. In mathematics, G&ouml;del could do the impossible. In the rest of life, G&ouml;del had a way of making the easy difficult. Sixty years later, G&ouml;del's citizenship hearing is legendary. Now, in 2008, decades after all the participants in that meeting have died, there's an important discovery about it.</p>
    <p>Uniquely among mathematicians, G&ouml;del was known for surprises. Most mathematicians prove things already believed to be true. Occasionally mathematicians prove things that other mathematicians weren't one hundred percent sure about. Rarely does a mathematician prove something most of the others thought must be false. And no mathematician had made a career of that kind of proof until Kurt G&ouml;del came along.</p>
    <p>When it came to this citizenship hearing, Einstein and Morgenstern were in no mood for surprises. So when G&ouml;del told them he'd found a contradiction in the U.S. Constitution, one that would allow the U.S. to be turned into a dictatorship, they told him to forget it. But G&ouml;del seemed to feel the need to share his discovery. If G&ouml;del started expounding on defects in the U.S. Constitution to the wrong kind of judge, Einstein and Morgenstern knew there could be trouble.</p>
    <p>In the decades since 1947, the tale of what happened at the hearing was told and retold, each time with differing incident and dialog. Certainly, there was a citizenship hearing. Probably G&ouml;del had some kind of proof about the US constitution, one which had Morgenstern and Einstein worried. More than that I didn't think we'd ever know.</p>
    <p>Not that there weren’t lots of stories. When I was a grad student, G&ouml;del was still alive. In the halls and offices, I heard many a tale of G&ouml;del's eccentric behavior. Over the years, I’ve learned that every one of those stories was unfounded and probably false.</p>
    <p>I expected that none of the various recountings of the citizenship hearing was to be trusted. Faculty room yarnsmanship had "improved" them to the point where they were useless. I also expected that the hearsay versions omitted a lot of important details.</p>
    <p>Now, to my surprise, we can know. I have discovered
    <a href="https://jeffreykegler.github.io/personal/morgenstern.html">
    Morgenstern's original account of G&ouml;del's citizenship hearing</a>,
    lost to scholarship for decades. How I found it, I'll describe in my next post.</p>
