    <h1>4th BCE: Pannini's description of Sanskrit</h1>
    <p>In India, Pannini creates an exact and complete description of
      the Sanskrit language, including pronunciation. Sanskrit could be
      recreated using nothing but Pannini's grammar.
      Pannini's grammar is
      probably the first formal system of any kind, predating Euclid. Even
      today, nothing like it exists for any other natural language of
      comparable size or corpus. Pannini is the object of serious study
      today. But in the 1940's and 1950's Pannini is almost unknown in
      the West. It will have no direct effect on the other events in
      this timeline.

    <h1>1906: Markov's chains</h1>
    <p>Andrey Markov introduces his
      <term>chains</term>
      -- a set of
      states with transitions between them.
      One offshoot of Markov's work will be what we now
      know as regular expressions.
      Markov uses his chains, not
      for parsing, but for solving problems in probability<footnote>
        Andrey Andreyevich Markov, "Extension of the law of large numbers to quantities, depending on each other" (1906).
        The title is a translation -- the original in Russian.

      With this, the process of rediscovering Pannini in the
      West begins.</p>
    <h1>1945: Turing discovers stacks</h1>
    <p>Alan Turing discovers the stack as part of his design of the
      ACE machine. This is important in parsing because recursive parsing
      requires stacks. The importance of Turing's discovery is not noticed
      at the time and stacks will be re-discovered many times over the
      next two decades<footnote>

    <h1>1948: Shannon repurposes Markov's chains</h1>
    <p>Claude Shannon publishes the foundation paper of information theory<footnote>
        "A Mathematical Theory of Communication"
      </footnote>.
      In this
      paper, Shannon makes an attempt to model English using Andrey Markov's
      chains.<footnote>pp. 4-6.
      </footnote>
    </p>
    <h1>1949: Rutishauser's compiler</h1>
    <p>From 1949 to 1951 at the ETH Zurich, Heinz Rutishauser worked on
      the design of what we would now call a compiler<footnote>
        Knuth and Pardo 1976,
        pp. 29-35, 40.
      </footnote>.
      Rutishauser's language is line-by-line and parsed as hoc, but it
      does parse arithmetic expressions. Rutishauser's expression parser
      did not honor precedence but did allow nested parentheses. It
      is perhaps the first algorithm which can really be considered a
      parsing method. Rutishauser's compiler was never implemented.</p>
    <h1>Operator Expressions</h1>
    <p>With Rutishauser's work, the parsing of operator expressions comes
      into the picture.
      Operators expressions are
      often treated a side issue.
      In fact, as this timeline will show,
      operator expressions are in fact central to the story of Western parsing theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Informally, operator are expressions built up from operands
      and operators.
      An operand can be another operator expression,
      so that operators expressions can be built up recursively.
    </p>
    <p>
      The archetypal examples of operator expressions are arithmetic expressions:
      "2+(3*4)", "13**2**-5*9/11", "1729-42*8675309", etc.
      In Western mathematics these were read according traditional ideas of
      associativity and precedence.
      Traditionally, in the above
    </p><ul>
      <li>'**' is exponentiation.
        It right associates and has tightest<footnote>
          This timeline refers to precedence levels as "tight"
          or "loose".
          The traditional terminology is confusing: tighter
          precedences are "higher", but traditionally the
          precendence levels are also numbered and the higher
          the number, the lower the precedence.
        </footnote>
        precedence.
      </li>
      <li>
        Multiplication ('*') and division ('/') left associate.
        They have a precedence equal to each other
        and less tight than exponentiation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Addition ('+') and subtraction ('-') left associate.
        They have a precedence equal to each other
        and less tight than multiplication and division.
      </li>
      <li>
        Parentheses, when present, override the traditional
        associativity and precedence.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Certainly in the first attempts at parsing in compilers,
      arithmetic expressions are central.
      The first compiled languages are organized line-by-line and,
      except for arithmetic expressions,
      lines are
      interpreted using basic string manipulations.
      It is only when those string manipulations turn to dealing
      with arithmetic expressions that they become sophisticated
      enough to be called parsing techniques,
      and having a parsing theory to describe them becomes helpful.
    </p>
    <h1>1950: Boehm's compiler</h1>
    <p>During 1950, Corrado Boehm, also at the ETH Zurich develops his
      own compiler. They are working at the same institution at the same
      time, but Boehm is unaware of Rutishauser's work until his own is
      complete. Like Rutishauser, Boehm's language is line-by-line and
      parsed ad hoc, except for expressions. Boehm's expression parser
      <em>does</em>
      honor precedence, making it perhaps the first operator precedence
      parser<footnote>
        Many of the "firsts" for parsing algorithms in this
        timeline are debatable,
        and the history of operator precedence is especially murky.
        Here I follow
        <bibref>Samuelson and Bauer 1960</bibref>
        in giving the priority to Boehm.
      </footnote>.
      Boehm's compiler also allows parentheses, but the two cannot
      be mixed -- an expression can either be parsed using precedence
      or have parentheses, but not both.</p>
    <p>Boehm's is also the first self-compiling compiler -- it is written
      in its own language. Like Rutishauser's, Boehm's compiler was never
      implemented<footnote>
        Knuth and Pardo 1976,
        pp 35-42.
      </footnote>.

    <h1>1952: Grace Hopper uses the term &quot;compiler&quot;</h1>
    <p>Grace Hopper writes a linker-loader.
      <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_compiler_construction#First_compilers%22">She
        calls it a &quot;compiler&quot;</a>. Hopper seems to be the first
      person to use this term for a computer program.</p>
    <h1>Term: &quot;Compiler&quot; as of 1952</h1>
    <p>Hopper used the term &quot;compiler&quot; in a meaning it
      had at the time: &quot;to compose out of materials from other
      documents&quot;<footnote>
        Quoted definition is from Nora B. Moser,
        "Compiler method of automatic programming",
        Symposium on Automatic Programming for Digital Computer,
        ONR, p. 15.,
        as cited in
        Knuth and Pardo 1976,
        p 51.
      </footnote>.
      Specifically, before Hopper, the task we now see as
      &quot;compiling&quot; was then seen putting together a set of
      pre-existing assembler subroutines and calling them. Hopper's new
      program went one step further -- instead of calling the subroutines
      it expanded them (or in other words &quot;compiled&quot; them) into
      a single program. Since Hopper the term has acquired a different
      and very specialized meaning in the computer field. Today we would
      not call Hopper's program a &quot;compiler&quot;<footnote>
        I hope nobody will interpret this terminological clarification as in any sense
        detracting from Hopper's achievement.
        Whatever it is called, Hopper's program was a major advance,
        both in terms of insight and execution, and her energetic followup
        did much to move forward the events in this timeline.
        Hopper has a big reputation and it is fully deserved</footnote>.
    </p><p>There were compilers written or described before Hopper,
      but nobody called them compilers -- compiling in our modern sense
      was called
      "automatic coding", "codification automatique" or "Rechenplanfertigung"<footnote>
        Knuth and Pardo 1976,
        p. 50.
      </footnote>.
    </p><h1>1952: Glennie's AUTOCODE</h1>
    <p>Knuth
      Knuth and Pardo 1976,
      p 42.
      calls Glennie's the first

        p 42.
      </footnote>
      compiler, by which he means that
      it was actually implemented and used by someone to translate
      algebraic statements into machine language.
      Glennie's AUTOCODE
      was very close to the machine -- too close to implement operator expressions.
      AUTOCODE was hard-to-use, and had little impact on
      other users of its target -- the Manchester Mark I.
      And because
      Glennie worked for the British atomic weapons projects his papers
      were routinely classified, so that the influence of AUTOCODE was
      slow to spread. Nonetheless, many other
      <term>compilers</term>
      afterward were named AUTOCODE, and this probably indicates some
      awareness of Glennie's effort<footnote>

    <h1>1954: The FORTRAN project begins</h1>
    <p>At IBM, a team under John Backus begins working on the language which will be called FORTRAN.</p>
    <h1>&quot;Compiler&quot; as of 1954</h1>
    <p>As of 1954, the term &quot;compiler&quot; was still being used
      in Hopper's looser sense, instead of its modern, specialized,
      one. In particular, there was no implication that the output of a
      &quot;compiler&quot; is ready for execution by a computer.<footnote>
        "http://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/FORTRAN/paper/Backus-ProgrammingInAmerica-1976.pdf
        pp. 133-134
      </footnote>
      The output of one 1954 &quot;compiler&quot;, for example, produced
      relative addresses, which needed to be translated by hand before
      a machine can execute them.</p>
    <h1>1955: Noam Chomsky starts teaching at MIT</h1>
    <p>Noam Chomsky is awarded a Ph.D. in linguistics and accepts a
      teaching post at MIT. MIT does not have a linguistics department and
      Chomsky is free to teach his own approach,
      Chomksy's linguistics course is
      highly original and very mathematical.</p>

    <p>The IT language had arithmetic expressions, of a sort --
      parentheses are honored, but otherwise evaluation is always
      right-to-left -- there is no operator precedence. IT did honor
      parentheses, but nonetheless its way of doing arithmetic expressions
      proves very unpopular: Donald Knuth reports that &quot;The lack of
      operator priority (often called precedence or hierarchy) in the IT
      language was the most frequent single cause of errors by the users
      of that compiler.&quot;<footnote>

    <p>In the 1956 document describing the IT compiler<footnote>

        in (1956) _Proceedings of the 1956 11th ACM national meeting_

    <h1>1956: The Chomsky hierarchy</h1>
    <p>Chomsky publishes the paper which is usually considered the foundation of Western formal language theory.<footnote>
        Chomsky, Noam. "Three models for the description of language", IEEE Trans. Inform.
        Theory, 2(3):113–124, 1956.
      </footnote>
      Chomsky demolishes the idea that natural language grammar can be
      modeled using only Markov chains. Instead, the paper advocates a
      natural language approach that uses three layers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Chomsky uses
        Markov's chains
        as his
        <b>bottom layer</b>.
        This becomes the modern compiler's
        <b>lexical phase</b>.</li></ul><!--
        html_fmt: Next end tag is cruft
      --></p>
    <!-- html_fmt: Next end tag is cruft -->
    </li>
    <ul><li>Chomsky's
        <b>middle layer</b>
        uses context-free
        grammars and context-sensitive grammars.
        These are his own
        discoveries<footnote>
          Chomsky seems
          to have been unaware of Post's work -- he does not cite it.
        </footnote>.
        This middle layer becomes the
        <b>syntactic phase</b>
        of modern
        compilers.</li>
      <li>Chomsky's
        <b>top layer</b>, again his own
        discovery, maps or
        <term>transforms</term>
        the output of the middle
        layer. Chomsky's top layer is the inspiration for AST transformation
        phase of modern compilers.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Term: &quot;Parsing&quot;</h1>
    <p>Chomsky is a turning point, so much so that it establishes or settles the
      meaning of many of the terms we are using. &quot;Parsing&quot;,
      for our purposes, is transforming a string of symbols into a
      structure. Typically this structure is a parse tree.</p>
    <h1>1957: Kleene's regular expressions</h1>
    <p>Steven Kleene discovers regular expressions, a very handy notation
      for Markov chains. It will turn out that several other mathematical objects
      being studied at this time
      are also equivalent to regular expressions: the various
      finite state automata; and some of the objects being studied as
      neural nets.</p>
    <h1>1957: Chomsky publishes
      <cite>Syntactic Structures</cite></h1>
    <p>Noam Chomsky publishes
      <em>Syntactic Structures</em>, one of the most important books of
      all time. The orthodoxy in 1957 is structural linguistics which
      argues, with Sherlock Holmes, that
      <q>it is a capital mistake
        to theorize in advance of the facts</q>. Structuralists start
      with the utterances in a language, and build upward.</p>
    <p>But Chomsky claims that without a theory there are no facts: there
      is only noise. The Chomskyan approach is to start with a grammar,
      and use the corpus of the language to check its accuracy. Chomsky's
      approach will soon come to dominate linguistics.</p>
    <h1>Term: &quot;Chomskyan parsing&quot;</h1>
    <p>In computing, parsing theory mainly follows Chomsky's work in
      linguistics. Parsing is &quot;Chomksyan&quot; if it is guided by
      a BNF grammar. From this point on, most parsers and most parsing
      theory will be Chomskyan; and this timeline will focus on Chomskyan
      parsing. But, as we shall see, non-Chomskyan parsing does survive
      and has its users today.</p>
    <h1>1957: FORTRAN released</h1>
    <p>Backus's team makes the first FORTRAN compiler available to IBM
      customers. FORTRAN is the first high-level language that will find
      widespread implementation. As of this writing, it is the oldest
      language that survives in practical use.</p>
    <p>FORTRAN is a line-by-line language and its parsing is pre-Chomskyan
      and ad hoc. But it includes one important discovery. FORTRAN I was
      line-by-line, but it allowed expressions. And, learning from the
      dissatisfaction with the compiler, FORTRAN honors associativity
      and precedence.</p>
    <p>The designers of FORTRAN discovered a strange trick --
      they hacked the expressions by adding parentheses around each
      operator. Surprisingly, this works. In fact, once the theoretical
      understanding of operator precedence comes about, the FORTRAN
      I implementation is actually a hackish and inefficient way of
      implementing precedence.</p>
    <h1>1958: LISP released</h1>
    <p>John McCarthy's LISP appears. LISP goes beyond the line-by-line
      syntax -- it is recursively structured. But the LISP interpreter does
      not find the recursive structure: the programmer must explicitly
      indicate the structure herself, using parentheses.
      Similarly, LISP does not have operator expressions in the usual sense --
      associativity and precedence must be specified with parentheses.
    </p>
    <h1>1959: Backus's notation</h1>
    <p>Backus discovers a new notation to describe the IAL language.
      (aka ALGOL)<footnote>.
        Backus's notation is influenced by his study of Post --
        he seems not to have read Chomsky until later.

        p. 25
      </footnote>
    </p>
    <h1>1960: BNF</h1>
    <p>Peter Naur improves the Backus notation and uses it to describe
      ALGOL 60. The improved notation will become known as Backus-Naur Form
      (BNF).</p>
    <h1>1960: The ALGOL report</h1>
    <p>The ALGOL 60 report specifies, for the first time, a block
      structured language. ALGOL 60 is recursively structured but the
      structure is implicit -- newlines are not semantically significant,
      and parentheses indicate syntax only in a few specific cases. The
      ALGOL compiler will have to find the structure. It is a case of 1960's
      optimism at its best. As the ALGOL committee is well aware, a parsing
      algorithm capable of handling ALGOL 60 does not yet exist. But the
      risk they are taking will soon pay off.</p>
    <p>With the ALGOL 60 report, a quest begins which continues to this day: the search for a parser that is</p>
    <ul>
      <li>efficient,</li>
      <li>practical,</li>
      <li>declarative, and</li>
      <li>general.</li>
    </ul><p>
      On one hand, the
      risk they are taking will pay off immediately, producting vastly improved
      parsers and parsing theory.
      On the other hand, the parser they seek will not be discovered for
      three decades,
      two more decades will pass before it is
      implemented.
    </p>
    <h1>Term:
      <term>declarative</term></h1>
    <p>For our purposes, a parser is
      <term>declarative</term>,
      if it
      will parse directly and automatically from grammars written in BNF.
      Declarative parsers are often called
      <term>syntax-driven</term>
      parsers.
    </p>
    <h1>Term:
      <term>procedural</term></h1>
    <p>A parser is
      <term>procedural</term>, if it requires procedural
      logic as part of its syntax phase.
      If a parser is procedural, then it is not declarative.
    </p><h1>Term:

    <p>A general parser is a parser that will parse
      any grammar that can be written in BNF<footnote>
        As a pedantic point, a general parser need only parse
        <term>proper</term>
        grammars. A BNF grammar is
        <term>proper</term>
        if it has no useless rules and no infinite loops.
        Neither of these
        have any practical use, so that the restriction to proper grammars
        is unproblematic.
      </footnote>.
      This is a very useful property
      -- it makes it easy for a grammar-writer to know that her grammar
      will parse.
      This in turn
      makes it easy to auto-generate grammars,
      because it is easy for a program to know that
      the grammar it generates will successfully parse.
      This opens the way
      to true second-order languages -- languages which specify other
      languages.</p>
    <h1>1960: Gleenie's compiler-compiler</h1>
    <p>A.E. Gleenie publishes his description of a compiler-compiler<footnote>
        <bibref>Glennie 1960</bibref>.
      </footnote>.
      Glennie's
      <term>universal compiler</term>
      is more of a methodology
      than an implementation -- the compilers must be written by
      hand.
    </p><p>
      Glennie have been the first to use BNF as
      a description of a
      <em>procedure</em>
      instead of as the description of a
      <em>Chomsky grammar</em><footnote>
        For the context-free BNF notation credits both Chomsky and Backus,
        and observes that the two notations are
        <term>related</term>.
        He also mentions
        Post's productions.

      .</p>
    <p>BNF and Chomsky's context free grammars were created primarily as means
      of grammar
      <b>description</b>.
      It is for this reason that BNF is often used in standards and language
      manuals, where it is expected that the readers of the BNF will be people
      not machines.
      Given a BNF notation,
      a human can very reasonably determine exactly what strings are and
      are not in a language, and the structure of the parses of those
      strings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, a notation exact enough to determine what string are and
      are not in a language,
      and their parses,
      and which does so in a way accessible to human readers,
      could drive a computer algorithm.
      At least so you would hope and expect.
    </p>
    <p>
      As this timeline will show, a practical declarative
      parser proved elusive.
      BNF remained an attractive notation, and in the place of
      declarative parsers, there arose, beginning with Glennie,
      parsers which are driven by BNF notation, but which do
      not parse the language described by that notation.
    </p>
    <!-- html_fmt: Next end tag is cruft -->
    </p><p>
      BNF
      notation, when used to describe a procedure, is a set of instructions,
      to be tried in some order, and used to process a string. Procedural
      BNF describes a procedure first, and a language only indirectly.</p>
    <p>
      I will call these
      <term>pseudo-declarative</term>
      parsers.
      To be sure, Glennie in
      <bibref>Glennie 1960</bibref>never pretends this parser is declarative.
      Glennie points the distinction out carefully,
      and notes that it is
      <q>important</q><footnote>
        <bibref>Glennie 1960</bibref>, Section 1.2, "A Notation for Syntax",
      </footnote>.
      But many subsequent writers will be less clear on the matter,
      and many more of the readers will suffer because of it.
      Many will waste time assuming that they can get eventually their test
      suite to write by writing BNF which describes it.
      Others will get their test suite to work,
      and will think (falsely)
      that this means that the language their parser parses is that
      specified by the BNF.
    </p><p>Both procedural and Chomskyan BNF describe languages, but usually
      <em>not the same</em>
      language. This is an important point, and one which will be
      overlooked many times in the years to come.</p>
    <p>[TODO: needs revision. ]
      The pre-Chomskyan approach, using procedural BNF, is far more
      natural to someone trained as a computer programmer. The parsing
      problem appears to the programmer in the form of strings to be
      parsed, exactly the starting point of procedural BNF and pre-Chomsky
      parsing.</p>
    <p>Even when the Chomskyan approach is pointed out, it does not
      at first seem very attractive. With the pre-Chomskyan approach,
      the examples of the language more or less naturally lead to a
      parser. In the Chomskyan approach the programmer has to search for
      an algorithm to parse strings according to his grammar -- and the
      search for good algorithms to parse Chomskyan grammars has proved
      surprisingly long and difficult. Handling semantics is more natural
      with a Chomksyan approach. But, using captures, semantics can be
      added to a pre-Chomskyan parser and, with practice, this seems
      natural enough.</p>
    <p>Despite the naturalness of the pre-Chomskyan approach to parsing,
      we will find that the first fully-described automated parsers
      are Chomskyan. This is a testimony to Chomsky's influence at the
      time. We will also see that Chomskyan parsers have been dominant
      ever since.</p>

    <p>Since FORTRAN I, many people have refined its operator precedence implementation.

        <bibref>Samuelson and Bauer 1960</bibref>.

      This paper was very influential.

    <h1>1961: The first parsing paper</h1>
    <p>In January, Ned Irons publishes a paper describing his ALGOL
      60 parser. It is the first paper to fully describe any parser. The
      Irons algorithm is Chomskyan and top-down with a bottom-up &quot;left
      corner&quot; element -- it is what now would be called a &quot;left
      corner&quot; parser.<footnote>
        <bibref>Irons 1961</bibref>.
        Among those who state that
        <bibref>Irons 1961</bibref>
        parser is what
        is now called "left-corner" is Knuth ("Top-down syntax analysis", p. 109).
      </footnote>
    </p>
    <p>You would expect parsing might start with hard-written
      parsers for specific grammar classes.
      But in fact, this first parser is declarative and general.
      And since it is general,
      operator expressions are well within the power of
      <bibref>Irons 1961</bibref>.

    <h1>Terms: &quot;Top-down&quot;</h1>
    <comment>TODO: Revise</comment>
    <p>A top-down parser, identifies BNF productions first,
      and only after that identifies the components of the productions.
      Therefore it starts with the start rule, and works down,
      until it reaches the
      reaching input tokens.
    </p>
    <p>It is important to note that no useful parser can be purely top-down --
      a pure top-down parser would never look at the input.
      So every top-parser we will consider has *some* kind of bottom-up element,
      though it may be very simple -- for example, one character lookahead.
      Useful top-down parsers usually follow Irons in having a sophisticated bottom-up element.
    </p>
    <h1>Terms: &quot;Bottom-up&quot;</h1>
    <comment>TODO: Revise</comment>
    <p>A bottom-up parser, as the name suggest, works in a way
      opposite to that of a top-down parser.
      It identifies the components of a BNF production before identifying
      a BNF production.
      Therefore, it starts with the input symbols, and works up,
      until it reaches the start rule.
    </p>
    <h1>Misconception: &quot;Top-down&quot; vs. &quot;bottom-up&quot;</h1>
    <p>A common, and important, misconception is that every parser is
      either top-down or bottom-up. A related misconception is that even
      parsers that are not clearly one or the other can always be usefully
      described in terms of their top-down and bottom-up components.
    </p>
    <p>As we saw, the
      <bibref>Irons 1961</bibref>
      parser is not simply top-down or
      bottom-up, though arguably describing it in terms of top-down and
      bottom-up components is helpful. But for other parsing algorithms,
      top-down vs. bottom-up classification is a pointless pedantry --
      the classification can be done, but tells you nothing about the
      actual behavior of the parser.</p>
    <h1>Terms: &quot;Synthetic attribute&quot;</h1>
    <p><bibref>Irons 1961</bibref>
      also introduces synthetic attributes: the parse creates
      a tree, which is evaluated bottom-up. Each node is evaluated using
      attributes &quot;synthesized&quot; from its child nodes.<footnote>
        Irons is credited with the discovery of synthetic attributes
        by Knuth ("Genesis of Attibute Grammars").
      </footnote>
    </p>
    <p>Pedantically, synthetic attributes are not a parsing concept --
      they are way of doing semantics. But almost nobody parses without
      intending to apply some kind of semantics, and feedback from new
      semantic concepts has had major effects on the development of
      parsing. Synthetic attributes will be important.</p>
    <h1>1961: Lucas discovers recursive descent</h1>
    <p>Peter Lucas publishes the first description of a purely top-down parser<footnote>
        Lucas 1961.
        I follow Grune and Jacobs 2008 in calling Lucas the discoverer of recursive descent.
        In fact, both
        <bibref>Irons 1961</bibref>
        and Lucas 1961 are recursive descent with a major bottom-up element.
        In conversation, Irons often described his 1961 parser as a kind of recursive descent.
        Perhaps Grune and Jacobs based their decision on the Lucas' description of his algorithm
        which talks about his parser's bottom-up element only briefly,
        while describing the top-down element in detail.
        Also, the Lucas algorithm more resembles modern implementations of recursive descent
        much more closely than
        <bibref>Irons 1961</bibref>.</footnote></p>
    <!-- html_fmt: Next end tag is cruft -->
    <!-- html_fmt: Next end tag is cruft -->
    </footnote><p>.
      Either Irons paper or this one can be considered to be recursive descent<footnote>
        As a former student of Irons at Yale,
        my personal preference would be to give Ned the credit
        for recursive descent.
        And this is what Peter Denning does in his introduction
        to the reprint of
        <bibref>Irons 1961</bibref>
        (<cite>Communications of the ACM</cite>, 25th Anniversary Issue, p. 14).
        But Grune and Jacobs 2008 gives the credit to Lucas 1961.
      </footnote>.
      Certainly the Lucas algorithm more closely resembles modern implementations of recursive descent.</p>
    <p>Except to say that he deals properly with them, Lucas does not say
      how he parses operator expressions. But it is easy to believe Lucas'
      claim -- by this time there are several specialized techniques for
      parsing operator expressions. Eventually there will be a botanical
      profusion of them.</p>
    <p>For our purposes, it is sufficient to note that while recursive
      descent cannot parse arithmetic expressions directly, it can deal
      with them in two ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Recursive descent can switch to another algorithm when
          it encounters an operator expression. This is easy to do in a
          hand-written implementation.</p></li>
      <li><p>It can parse the operands and operands into a list, and
          the list can be reparsed in post-processing. This is essentially
          a delayed-action form of the first method.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <h1>1960's: Hand-coded recursive descent</h1>
    <p>Lucas' writeup most likely describes a hand-written
      parser. Hand-coded approaches became more popular than declarative
      ones in the 1960's due to three factors:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Memory and CPU were both extremely limited. Hand-coding
          paid off, even when the gains were small.</p></li>
      <li><p>Pure recursive descent is, in fact, a very weak parsing
          technique. As we have seen in the case of operator expressions,
          it is often necessary to go beyond its limits, and that is easier
          to do if you are coding the parser by hand.</p></li>
      <li><p>Top-down parsing is intuitive -- it essentially means
          calling subroutines. It therefore requires little or no knowledge of
          parsing theory. This makes it a good fit for hand-coding.</p></li>

      <a
href="https://www.engr.mun.ca/~theo/Misc/exp_parsing.htm">Theodore
        Norvell has made an attempt at classification</a>
      of the botanical profusion of operator expression parsers. All
      earlier parsers are subspecies of what he calls &quot;the classic
      algorithm&quot;, so that Dijkstra's approach is new. The number
      of level of precedence is not &quot;built in&quot; into the
      shunting-yard algorithm. And the shunting-yard algorithm is more
      efficient than the classic approaches: Code size does not grow,
      and the algorithm's speed does not decrease, with the number of
      precedence levels. Dijkstra's algorithm is not a game-changer --
      it has no major impact on the Operator Issue -- but it offers a
      genuinely different implementation alternative.</p>
    <h1>The operator issue as of 1961</h1>
    <p>Originally the operator issue was that it required a parsing
      algorithm at a time
      when there were no parsing algorithms.
      With Lucas paper, the operator issue takes a new form --
      one which it still has over 50 years later.
      Specifically, recursive descent cannot parse this very simple operator grammar:
    </p><ul>
      <li>S ::= E</li>
      <li>E ::= E + T</li>
      <li>E ::= T</li>
      <li>T ::= T * F</li>
      <li>T ::= F</li>
      <li>F ::= number</li>
    </ul><p>
      In fact recursive descent cannot parse any left recursive grammar.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the problem is even more severe than that.
      For human readers, left association is natural for most operators,
      and they would find reversing it to be very confusing.
      But suppose we ignore that face and rewrite the above grammar to be right
      recursive:
    </p><ul>
      <li>S ::= E</li>
      <li>E ::= T + E</li>
      <li>E ::= T</li>
      <li>T ::= F * T</li>
      <li>T ::= F</li>
      <li>F ::= number</li>
    </ul><p>
      Recursive descent cannot parse this grammar either --
      the lookahead required is just too much for it.
    </p><p>This means that by itself, recursive descent is never
      sufficient for practical grammars -- it must always be part of a
      hybrid.

      At the time, they call their approach syntax-directed,

      procedural notation, and does not necessarily describe the

    <p>Don Knuth discovers LR parsing. The LR algorithm is deterministic,
      Chomskyan and bottom-up. Knuth is primarily interested in the
      mathematics, and the parsing algorithm he gives is not practical. He
      leaves development of practical LR parsing algorithms as an &quot;open
      question&quot; for &quot;future research&quot;.<footnote>

    </p>
    <h1>Misconception: deterministic parsing versus deterministic parsers</h1>
    <p>TODO
    </p>
    <h1>1968</h1>
    <p>When Knuth discovered the LR grammars, he announced them to
      the world with a full-blown mathematical description. The top-down
      grammars, which arose historically, lack such a description. In 1968,
      Lewis and Stearns fill that gap by defining the LL(k) grammars.<footnote>
        They are credited in Rosencrantz and Stearns (1970)
        and Aho and Ullman, p. 368.
      </footnote>
    </p>
    <h1>Terms: &quot;LL&quot;, &quot;LR&quot;, &quot;RL&quot; and &quot;RR&quot;</h1>
    <p>When LL is added to the vocabulary of parsing, the meaning of
      &quot;LR&quot; shifts slightly. In 1965 Knuth meant LR to mean
      &quot;translatable from left to right&quot;.<footnote>
        Knuth 1965, p. 610.
        See on p. 611
        "corresponds with the intuitive notion of translation
        from left to right looking k characters ahead".
      </footnote>
      LL means &quot;scan from the left, using left reductions&quot;
      and LR acquires its current meaning of scan from the left, using
      right reductions&quot;.<footnote>
        Knuth, "Top-down syntax analysis", p. 102.
      </footnote>
    </p>
    <p>LL and LR have mirror images: RL means &quot;scan from the right,
      using left reductions&quot; and RR acquires its current meaning
      of scan from the right, using right reductions&quot;. Use of these
      mirror images is rare, but does occur -- operator expression parsing
      in the IT compiler seems to have been RL(2) with backtracking.
    </p>
    <p>If there is a number after the parentheses in this notation for
      parsing algorithms, it usually indicates the number of tokens of
      lookahead. RL(2) above, meant that the algorithm looked 2 tokens
      ahead.</p>
    <h1>LL(1) and the Operator Issue</h1>
    <p>Of the algorithms in our new notation, LL(1) -- &quot;scan from the
      left, using left reductions with one character of lookahead&quot; --
      is one of the more important ones. Before the introduction of this
      notation, and the mathematics behind it, the Operator Issue could
      not be described in precise terms.</p>
    <p>Now we can state one form of the Operator Issue in more exact
      terms: Recursive Descent, in its pure form, is LL(1). Arithmetic
      operator grammars are not LL(1). Something has to give as long as you
      are using recursive descent. And this is a major reason why truly
      declarative versions of LL(1) are not used. A pure declarative
      LL(1) parser generator
      <em>could</em>
      be written, but it would not be able to parse arithmetic expressions
      properly.</p>
    <h1>1968</h1>
    <p>Jay Earley discovers the algorithm named after him. Like the Irons
      algorithm, Earley's algorithm is Chomskyan, declarative and fully
      general. Unlike the Irons algorithm, it does not backtrack. Earley's
      algorithm is both top-down and bottom-up at once -- it uses dynamic
      programming and keeps track of the parse in tables. Earley's approach
      makes a lot of sense and looks very promising indeed, but there are
      three serious issues:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>First, there is a bug in the handling of zero-length rules.</li>
      <li>Second, it is quadratic for right recursions.</li>
      <li>Third, the bookkeeping required to set up the tables is,
        by the standards of 1968 hardware, daunting.</li>

      </footnote>
      Irons' synthetic attributes had always been inadequate for many
      problems, and had been supplemented by side effects or state
      variables. Knuth adds inherited attributes, and discovers attribute
      grammars.</p>
    <h1>Term: &quot;Inherited attributes&quot;</h1>
    <p>Recall that a node in parse gets its synthetic attributes from
      its parents. Inherited attributes are attibutes a node gets from
      its parents. Of course, this creates potential circularities, but
      inherited attributes are powerful and, with care, the circularities
      can be dealt with.</p>

      and its descendants, regular expressions will become an everyday
      part of the working programmer's toolkit.</p>
    <h1>Recognizers</h1>
    <p>In comparing algorithms, it can be important to keep in mind whether they are recognizers or parsers. A
      <em>recognizer</em>
      is a program which takes a string and produces a &quot;yes&quot;
      or &quot;no&quot; according to whether a string is in part of a
      language. Regular expressions are typically used as recognizers. A
      <em>parser</em>
      is a program which takes a string and produces a tree reflecting
      its structure according to a grammar. The algorithm for a compiler
      clearly must be a parser, not a recognizer. Recognizers can be,
      to some extent, used as parsers by introducing captures.</p>
    <h1>1972</h1>
    <p>Alfred Aho and Jeffrey Ullman publish a two volume textbook
      summarizing the theory of parsing. This book is still important. It
      is also distressingly up-to-date -- progress in parsing theory
      slowed dramatically after 1972. Aho and Ullman describe a
      straightforward fix to the zero-length rule bug in Earley's
      original algorithm. Unfortunately, this fix involves adding even
      more bookkeeping to Earley's.</p>
    <h1>1972</h1>
    <p>Under the names TDPL and GTDPL, Aho and Ullman investigate
      the non-Chomksyan parsers in the Schorre lineage. They note that
      &quot;it can be quite difficult to determine what language is
      defined by a TDPL parser&quot;. That is, GTDPL parsers do whatever
      they do, and that whatever is something the programmer in general
      will not be able to describe. The best a programmer can usually
      do is to create a test suite and fiddle with the GTDPL description
      until it passes. Correctness cannot be established in any stronger
      sense. GTDPL is an extreme form of the old joke that &quot;the code is
      the documentation&quot; -- with GTDPL nothing documents the language
      of the parser, not even the code.</p>
    <p>GTDPL's obscurity buys nothing in the way of additional parsing
      power. Like all non-Chomskyan parsers, GTDPL is basically a extremely
      powerful recognizer. Pressed into service as a parser, it is
      comparatively weak. As a parser, GTDPL is essentially equivalent to
      Lucas's 1961 algorithm, which was in turn a restricted
      form of recursive descent.</p>
    <p>At or around this time, rumor has it that the main line of
      development for GTDPL parsers is classified secret by the US
      government.<footnote>
        http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Talk:Metacompiler/Archive_2</footnote>
      GTDPL parsers have the property that even small changes in GTDPL parsers can be very labor-intensive. For some government contractors, GTDPL parsing provides steady work for years to come. Public interest in GTDPL fades.</p>
    <h1>1973: Pratt parsing</h1>
    <p>One approach to the Operator Issue has not been mentioned. We
      have noted that LL(1) cannot parse operator expressions. What about
      making the entire grammar an operator grammar? That way you don't
      have to mix algorithms.</p>
    <p>There are many problems with switching to operator
      grammars. Operator grammar are non-Chomskyan -- the BNF no longer
      accurately describes the grammar. Instead the BNF becomes part of
      a combined notation, and the actual grammar parsed depends also on
      precedence and semantics. And operator grammars have a restricted
      form -- most practical languages are not operator grammars.</p>
    <p>But many practical grammars are almost operator grammars. And the
      Chomskyan approach has always had its dissenter. Vaughn Pratt was one
      of these, and discovered a new approach (the third and last in
      <a
    href="https://www.engr.mun.ca/~theo/Misc/exp_parsing.htm">Theodore
        Norvell's taxonomy</a>) to operator expression parsing, one which
      some have adopted as an overall solution to their parsing problems.<footnote>
        Vaughan R Pratt,
        "Top down operator precedence",
        in
        <cite>First ACM Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages</cite>,
        pages 41–51. ACM, Oct. 1973.
      </footnote>
    </p>
    <p>The Pratt approach, and its descendant, precedence climbing,
      is not popular as an overall strategy. It is most often used as the
      operator expression subparser within a recursive descent strategy. All
      operator expression subparsers breaks the Chomskyan paradigm so the
      non-Chomskyan nature of Pratt's parser is not a problem in this
      context. But with respect to the Operator Issue, like Dijkstra's
      alternative, it is an implementation choice, not a game-changer.</p>

    <p>Bell Labs converts its C compiler from hand-written recursive
      descent to DeRemer's LALR algorithm.</p>
    <h1>1977</h1>
    <p>The first &quot;Dragon book&quot; comes out. This soon-to-be
      classic textbook is nicknamed after the drawing on the front cover,
      in which a knight takes on a dragon. Emblazoned on the knight's lance
      are the letters &quot;LALR&quot;. From here on out, to speak lightly
      of LALR will be to besmirch the escutcheon of parsing theory.</p>
    <h1>1979</h1>
    <p>Bell Laboratories releases Version 7 UNIX. V7 includes what is,
      by far, the most comprehensive, useable and easily available compiler
      writing toolkit yet developed.</p>
    <h1>1979</h1>
    <p>Part of the V7 toolkit is Yet Another Compiler Compiler
      (YACC). YACC is LALR-powered. Despite its name, YACC is the first
      compiler-compiler in the modern sense. For some useful languages, the
      process of going from Chomskyan specification to executable is fully
      automated. Most practical languages, including the C language and
      YACC's own input language, still require manual hackery. Nonetheless,
      after two decades of research, it seems that the parsing problem
      is solved.</p>
    <h1>1987</h1>
    <p>Larry Wall introduces Perl 1. Perl embraces complexity like no
      previous language. Larry uses YACC and LALR very aggressively --
      to my knowledge more aggressively than anyone before or since.</p>
    <h1>1990</h1>
    <p>
      Wadler starts to introduce monads to the functional programming community.
      As one example he converts his previous efforts at function parsing
      techniques<footnote>
        Philip Wadler,
        "Comprehending Monads"
        In
        <cite>Proceedings of the 1990 ACM conference on LISP and functional programming</cite>
        (LFP '90).
        ACM, New York, NY, USA, 61-78. DOI=http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/91556.91592
      </footnote>.
      The parsing technique is pure recursive descent.
      The examples shown for monadic parsing are very simple,
      and do not include operator expressions.
      In his earlier non-monadic work, Wadler uses a very restricted form of operator expression:
      His grammar avoided left recursion by using parentheses,
      and operator precedence was not implemented<footnote>
        Wadler 1985.</footnote>.
    </p>
    <h1>1991</h1>
    <p>Joop Leo discovers a way of speeding up right recursions in
      Earley's algorithm. Leo's algorithm is linear for just about every
      unambiguous grammar of practical interest, and many ambiguous ones
      as well. In 1991 hardware is six orders of magnitude faster than
      1968 hardware, so that the issue of bookkeeping overhead had receded
      in importance. This is a major discovery. When it comes to speed,
      the game has changed in favor of the Earley algorithm.</p>
    <p>But Earley parsing is almost forgotten. Twenty years will
      pass before anyone writes a practical implementation of Leo's
      algorithm.</p>
    <h1>The 1990's</h1>
    <p>Earley's is forgotten. So everyone in LALR-land is content,
      right? Wrong. Far from it, in fact. Users of LALR are making
      unpleasant discoveries. While LALR automatically generates their
      parsers, debugging them is so hard they could just as easily write the
      parser by hand. Once debugged, their LALR parsers are fast for correct
      inputs. But almost all they tell the users about incorrect inputs
      is that they are incorrect. In Larry's words, LALR is &quot;fast
      but stupid&quot;.</p>
    <h1>1992</h1>
    <p>Combinators are parsers which can be "combined" to compose other parsers.
      This allows you to have an algebra of parsers.
      It's an extremely attractive idea,
      and suggestive of great power,
      but in fact underneath it is nothing but recursive descent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Combinator parsing
      was introduced in two 1992 papers<footnote>
        Some source consider
        <bibref>Wadler 1985</bibref>
        an
        early presentation of the ideas of combinator parsing.
        In assigning priority here,
        I follow Grune and Jacobs 2008 (p. 564).
      </footnote>.
      Of more interest
      to us is the one by Hutton, which focuses on combinator parsing<footnote>
        The paper which is devoted to parsing is
        <bibref>Hutton 1992</bibref>.
        The other paper, which centers on combinators as a programming
        paradigm, is
        Frost, Richard A. Constructing programs as executable attribute
        grammars. Computer J., 35(4):376–389, 1992.
        Frost only mentions parsing in one paragraph, and
        that focuses on implementation issues.
        Some of his grammars include operator expressions,
        but these avoid left recursion,
        and implement precedence and associativity,
        using parentheses.
      </footnote>.
      Combinators will become important in programming languages and
      semantics. But in terms of parsing algorithms, Hutton introduces
      nothing new -- wrapped up in an attribute grammar; underlying the
      exciting new mathematics is the decades-old recursive descent,
      unchanged.
    </p><p>Hutton's example language is very basic --
      his expressions require left association,
      but not precedence.
      Left association is implemented by post-processing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hutton's main presentation does not use monads.
      In his final pages, however,
      Hutton points out
      "combinator parsers give rise to a monad" and shows
      how his presentation could be rewritten in a form
      closely related to monads<footnote>
        <bibref>Hutton 1992</bibref>, pp. 19-20.

    <h1>1995</h1><p>
      Today monads are a hot topic.
      In their adaptation into the world of
      programming,
      the 1995 article by Wadler
      <footnote>
        Wadler Philip. (1995) Monads for functional programming. In:
        Jeuring J., Meijer E. (eds) Advanced Functional Programming. AFP
        1995. Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol 925. Springer,
        Berlin, Heidelberg.
      </footnote>
      is a turning point.
      One of Wadler's examples is a parser based on
      monads and combinator parsing.
      From here on out,
      an combinator parsing will become the standard
      example of monad programming.
    </p>
    <p>In its monadic form,
      the already attractive technique of combinator parsing is extremely elegant
      and certainly seems as if it *should* solve all parsing problems.
      But, once again, it is still recursive descent.
      Wadler handles left recursion by rewriting into
      right recursive list, and re-processing the list
      into left recursive form.
      Wadler's example grammar only has one operator,
      so the issue of precedence does not arise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of one paradigm to solve them all,
      Wadler ends up with a two layered approach,
      with a hackish bottom layer and an awkward interface.
      This undercuts
      the simplicity and elegance of the combinator approach.
    </p>
    <h1>1996</h1><p>
      Wadler had used parsing as an example to motivate
      his presentation of monads.
      In 1996, Graham Hutton and Erik Meijer<footnote>
        <bibref>Hutton and Meijer 1996</bibref>
      </footnote>
      take the opposite perspective -- they
      write a paper on combinator parsing that could
      "also be viewed as a first introduction to the use
      of monads in programming."

    <p>John Aycock and R. Nigel Horspool publish their attempt at a
      fast, practical Earley's parser. Missing from it is Joop Leo's
      improvement -- they seem not to be aware of it. Their own speedup
      is limited in what it achieves and the complications it introduces
      can be counter-productive at evaluation time. But buried in their
      paper is a solution to the zero-length rule bug. And this time the
      solution requires no additional bookkeeping.</p>
    <h1>2004</h1>
    <p>Bryan Ford publishes his paper on PEG. Ford fills this gap by
      repackaging the nearly-forgotten GTDPL. Ford adds packratting,
      so that PEG is always linear, and provides PEG with an attractive
      new syntax.</p>
    <p>Implementers by now are avoiding YACC, but the demand for
      declarative parsers remains. PEG is not, in fact, declarative,
      but it uses the same BNF notation, and many users don't know the
      difference. And nothing has been done to change
      <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.io/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/individual/2015/03/peg.html">the problematic behaviors</a>
      of GTDPL.</p>
    <h1>2006</h1>
    <p>GNU announces that the GCC compiler's parser has been
      rewritten. For three decades, the industry's flagship C compilers have
      used LALR as their parser -- proof of the claim that LALR and serious
      parsing are equivalent. Now, GNU replaces LALR with the technology
      that it replaced a quarter century earlier: recursive descent.</p>
    <h1>Today</h1>
    <p>After five decades of parsing theory, the state of the art seems
      to be back where it started. We can imagine someone taking Ned Iron's
      original 1961 algorithm from the first paper ever published describing
      a parser, and republishing it today. True, he would have to translate
      its code from the mix of assembler and ALGOL into something more
      fashionable, say Haskell. But with that change, it might look like
      a breath of fresh air.</p>

    </p><h1>Marpa: an afterword</h1>
    <p>The recollections of my teachers cover most of this timeline. My
      own begin around 1970. Very early on, as a graduate student, I became
      unhappy with the way the field was developing. Earley's algorithm
      looked interesting, and it was something I returned to on and off.</p>
    <p>Recall that the original vision of the 1960's was a parser that
      was efficient, practical, general, and declarative.</p>
    <p>By 2010 this vision seemed to have gone the same way as many other
      1960's dreams. The rhetoric stayed upbeat, but parsing practice had
      become a series of increasingly desperate compromises.</p>
    <p>But, while nobody was looking for them, the solutions to
      the problems encountered in the 1960's had appeared in the
      literature. Aycock and Horspool had solved the zero-length rule
      bug. Joop Leo had found the speedup for right recursion. And the
      issue of bookkeeping overhead had pretty much evaporated on its
      own. Machine operations are now a billion times faster than in 1968,
      and are probably no longer relevant in any case -- cache misses are
      now the bottleneck.</p>
    <p>The programmers of the 1960's would have been prepared to trust
      a fully declarative Chomskyan parser. With the experience with LALR
      in their collective consciousness, modern programmers might be more
      guarded. As Lincoln said,
      <q>Once a cat's been burned, he won't
        even sit on a cold stove.</q>
      But I found it straightforward to
      rearrange the Earley parse engine to allow efficient event-driven
      handovers between procedural and declarative logic. And Earley
      tables provide the procedural logic with full knowledge of the state
      of the parse so far, so that Earley's algorithm is a better platform
      for hand-written procedural logic than recursive descent.</p>
