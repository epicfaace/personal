          The God Proof is a novel, but it is about a real proof claimed by Kurt
          G&ouml;del, Einstein's closest friend.
	  Many people have tried to prove
          God's existence.
	  You can certainly doubt that it's possible.
	  What you
          can't question is that if anyone could do it, G&ouml;del could.
	  <cite>Time</cite> magazine
          called G&ouml;del the greatest mathematician of the last century.
	  Oppenheimer,
          scientific director of the project that built the atomic bomb, called
          G&ouml;del "the greatest logician since Aristotle."
	  G&ouml;del earned his
          reputation with airtight proofs of unexpected results.
        </p>
        <p>
          The shy G&ouml;del feared ridicule.
	  He probably told Einstein about his God
          Proof, but he told nobody else until 1970, and he never went public.
	  After
          G&ouml;del's death, his papers were found in careful order.
	  We know what
          is missing and what is not. Everything was there, with two exceptions:
          the notebooks with his work on the God Proof.

          In researching the novel,
          I taught myself the math behind the proof,
          and became proficient enough to assist the professionals in their research
